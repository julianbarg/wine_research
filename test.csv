Sustainable agriculture had been the intersections of our passions and careers importing and distributing organic foods, however we'd never been farmers.
Our rural home was on 20 acres of land originally part of a larger farm established in the 1830s and abandoned following WWII. We have added neighboring acreage that was part of the original farm and today our family farm totals 80 acres located in New York State in Allegany county. We have an abundance of long forgotten old growth apple trees where we have cleared brush and thorns (multi floral rose, grrrrr!) to give them light and space. We've planted a small orchard with more apples, as well as peaches, cherries, apricots, and pears. We're in the process of establishing a vineyard. Recently we began to wild forage ramps and deliver to farm to fork restaurants in Manhattan and Brooklyn and leading retailers like Wegmans. This year we started to inoculate bolts of beech logs with mycelium to grow mushrooms. We have chickens and ducks and turkeys. We have raised pigs. We're learning more about cows and see their addition to the farm in the near future.
All parents worry about what they feed their kids. We felt a powerful impulse to nurture the land with and for them. We wanted to better understand what it meant to farm sustainably. We are learning as we go as a family, and increasingly our three children are leading projects around the farm. We participate in farmer trainings locally and attend Biodynamic Conferences to increase our understanding of farming to the Demeter standard. Sometimes it's difficult to separate play from work at the Yellow Barn Farm. We spend time together as a family, and we know our farmer!

Healdsburg, CA 95448, United States",Biodynamic | Farm | Vineyard | ,"Fruit,Grapes For Wine",20170515,info@pumasprings.com,Puma Springs Vineyards,,,"Tony Crabb and Barbara Grasseschi were ready for a change when they purchased a somewhat neglected vineyard just north of Healdsburg, California in 2000.
Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and finally to California’s Silicon Valley. After starting his own companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines held more interest for Barbara every day.
Biodiversity
Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard areas, providing weed control for us – and entertainment for the neighbors.
A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.
Energy Conservation
Puma Springs’ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system provides all hot water for the office.
Terroir
Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.
Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. Biodynamics is not only good for the earth and good for the environment; it helps produce exceptional wine grapes.

Hood Organic Farm,541-352-7492,,"Specialty varieties of apples and pears grown at the foot of Mt Hood in Oregon's Hood River Valley. Irrigated with glacial water and picked at the peak of ripeness, our 7 varieties of pears and 43 varieties of apples are known for their superior flavor. We pack and ship our own fruit, which is sold directly at our farm in the fall, at farmers markets, to CSA's and to wholesalers who distribute our fruit across the country. We will soon be shipping packed gift boxes as well.
Although the farm dates to the turn of the century (the main farmhouse was built in 1904), John and Brady Jacobson began working the orchards in 1981. Inspired by European techniques and committed to sustainable land use, the Jacobsons undertook an extensi\ve orchard renovation and transition to organic farming that resulted in full organic certification in 1989 - the first farm in the valley to achieve this status. Numerous publications from The Oregonian to the Good Fruit Grower have written articles about the farm, and the BBC and PBS have also interviewed and filmed here.
As better reflects their view of the importance of the integration of the natural landscape and wildlife into their farming practices, and returning to the deeper origins of the organic movement, Brady and John have now become Biodynamic® growers. They also take pride in selling directly to loyal customers of the farm, as well as to regional markets, and donate a portion of their produce to School Aid®, a program in partnership with local markets and the Oregon Food Bank.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms is a unique, secluded, spectacular natural setting for hosting your one or two day weekend wedding retreat.

The vineyard is part of the Eola-Amity AVA (American Viticultural Area), a wine region blessed with the cooling afternoon Van Duzer Winds from the ocean during the warm ripening season. This helps retain good acidity and balance in the fruit we grow in the volcanic, shallow soils of the area.
Our story begins in 1989 when Craig and Gabriele Keeler were searching for properties to begin a new chapter in their lives and decided to take a walk through a picturesque hillside in Amity, Oregon. When Gabriele saw, on this long time abandoned, overgrown with blackberries, piece of land, the view to the south with views of Mary's Peak and Oregon's coastal mountains she grabbed Craig's hand and said ""CK, this is the place!"".  In 1990 the Keeler family moved to their 200 acre property and through many years of hard work they transformed what was once fields of blackberry's, rocky terrain and dilapidated structures to what is today; a home and Keeler Estate Vineyard.  It's a truly magical place consisting of a thriving biodynamic vineyard, gardens, forest, lakes, streams, acres of landscaping and plenty room for entertaining.
