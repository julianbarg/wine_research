 'profile': 'Brooks Winery came to life in 1998, after founder Jimi Brooks had '
            'spent time in France, where he worked with wineries who were '
            'using biodynamic farming principles in their vineyards. Seeing '
            'parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting '
            'healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon '
            'and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  '
            'in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its '
            'environment became a key element of his approach.\n'
            'This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the '
            'Brooks program from the beginning. “If the vine is happy, the '
            'grapes simply taste better.” Jimi once said, “I believe that '
            'farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem '
            'intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of '
            'terroir.”\n'
            'The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in '
            'the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot '
            'Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other '
            'cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir '
            'in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a '
            'disservice to them to use any other farming method that would '
            'intrude on what the earth provides.\n'
            'Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified '
            'until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These '
            'vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the '
            'oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this '
            'vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the '
            'essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.\n'
            'Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away '
            'at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks '
            'Wine. Winemaker friends who’d gathered at his memorial service '
            'compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimi’s '
            'philosophy. A dozen of Oregon’s top winemakers saw the 2004 '
            'vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimi’s assistant) '
            'became Head Winemaker; Jimi’s sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took '
            'over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of '
            'Brooks’ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these '
            'values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no '
            'surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything '
            'in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter '
            'farming.\n'
            'Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a '
            'dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in '
            'all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooks’ story figured '
            'prominently in “American Wine Story,” a film about inspiration '
            'and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals '
            'around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will '
            'be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and we’re been able to '
            'increase the number of outside vineyards we’re able to source '
            'grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that '
            'they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout '
            'the process.\n'
            'The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look '
            'forward to your stopping by when you’re in the area.\n'

            'Our miller is Gary Thelen of Freeport, Minnesota. Gary is a third '
            'generation miller who took over the 100+ year old historic flour '
            'mill from his father, Walter. The mill has been in his family '
            'since 1903 and was listed on the National Register of Historic '
            'Places. As a young man, Gary worked on the family farm and was '
            'married to Sharon in 1982. In 1985 he began to focus more on the '
            'milling operation and in 1998 he completely took over the mill. '
            'Since then Gary has been carrying on and growing the family '
            'business. On December 27, 2011, two days after Christmas, Gary’s '
            'entire historic mill burned to the ground. With much '
            'encouragement from family, friends and business associates Gary '
            'rebuilt a new mill on the same site and struggled to rebuild his '
            'business.\n'
            'HOW THE PUZZLE FITS TOGETHER\n'
            'In the Fall of 2011 Lynda had an idea . . . what a great gift it '
            'would be to bring a Biodynamic Whole Wheat Flour into the world. '
            'And, as she shared this dream with her daughter, Jessica, the '
            'question arose, “What’s holding you back?” This simple question '
            'was the beginning of our journey to ISIS Biodynamic.\n'
            'Lynda began to seek out a stone-grinding flour mill and luckily, '
            'through a friend in the industry, was able to locate one. We '
            'needed a place to put it and thought of Gary back in Freeport '
            'trying to recover from the fire. We asked Gary if he would house '
            'the mill and make our flour. He agreed and the mill was '
            'installed, inspected and certified by the Demeter Association.\n'
            'Meanwhile Lynda and Jess had been making periodic visits to the '
            'Stone Barns Center for Agriculture in New York to see Fred '
            'Kirschenmann. We mentioned to Fred that we had purchased a mill '
            'and wanted to make Biodynamic® Whole Wheat Flour from his Wheat. '
            'Fred loved the idea and agreed to grow the Wheat for us.\n'
            'The rest is history, or should we say, the future! We are also '
            'delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Whole Foods '
            'Market team, and appreciate their dedication and support of '
            'providing Biodynamic® products nationwide.\n'

            'Verified ingredients, and 1/3 less sugar than traditional '
            'preserves. Amazing fruit taste, better nutrition with only 30 '
            'calories per serving, and no preservatives or colors; just clean, '
            'organic fruity goodness. From source to spread, Crofter’s great '
            'taste shines, and makes every day perfectly sweet!\n'
            'Our motivation behind producing Biodynamic® spreads stems from '
            'our belief that food should be produced organically, in the most '
            'sustainable way possible, and benefit the environment. Since the '
            'founding of Crofter’s Organic, John Warner, M.Sc., P.Ag, has been '
            'integral to shaping our quality management programs. Warner grew '
            'up on his family’s local Biodynamic® farm, and still works the '
            'farm today. Using his knowledge of Biodynamic® principles and '
            'degree in environmental toxicology, Warner shaped Crofter’s early '
            'organic system, long before there were standardized USDA Organic '
            'regulations. With Crofter’s Biodynamic® fruit spreads, we are '
            'really going back to our roots.',
