            'spent time in France, where he worked with wineries who were '
            'using biodynamic farming principles in their vineyards. Seeing '
            'parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting '
            'healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon '
            'and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  '
            'in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its '
            'environment became a key element of his approach.\n'
            'This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the '
            'Brooks program from the beginning. “If the vine is happy, the '
            'grapes simply taste better.” Jimi once said, “I believe that '
            'farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem '
            'intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of '
            'terroir.”\n'
            'The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in '
            'the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot '
            'Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other '
            'cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir '
            'in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a '
            'disservice to them to use any other farming method that would '
            'intrude on what the earth provides.\n'
            'Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified '
            'until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These '
            'vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the '
            'oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this '
            'vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the '
            'essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.\n'
            'Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away '
            'at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks '
            'Wine. Winemaker friends who’d gathered at his memorial service '
            'compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimi’s '
            'philosophy. A dozen of Oregon’s top winemakers saw the 2004 '
            'vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimi’s assistant) '
            'became Head Winemaker; Jimi’s sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took '
            'over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of '
            'Brooks’ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these '
            'values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no '
            'surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything '
            'in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter '
            'farming.\n'
            'Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a '
            'dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in '
            'all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooks’ story figured '
            'prominently in “American Wine Story,” a film about inspiration '
            'and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals '
            'around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will '
            'be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and we’re been able to '
            'increase the number of outside vineyards we’re able to source '
            'grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that '
            'they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout '
            'the process.\n'
            'The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look '
            'forward to your stopping by when you’re in the area.\n'

 'profile': 'Tony Crabb and Barbara Grasseschi were ready for a change when '
            'they purchased a somewhat neglected vineyard just north of '
            'Healdsburg, California in 2000.\n'
            'Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive '
            'career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and '
            'finally to California’s Silicon Valley. After starting his own '
            'companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a '
            'vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, '
            'a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, '
            'rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and '
            'letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines '
            'held more interest for Barbara every day.\n'
            'Biodiversity\n'
            'Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium '
            'quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to '
            'us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the '
            'number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. '
            'Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract '
            'swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the '
            'vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil '
            'erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and '
            'provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats '
            'live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard '
            'areas, providing weed control for us – and entertainment for the '
            'neighbors.\n'
            'A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat '
            'for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central '
            'Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing '
            'and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.\n'
            'Energy Conservation\n'
            'Puma Springs’ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with '
            'our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need '
            'for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides '
            'power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative '
            'office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system '
            'provides all hot water for the office.\n'
            'Terroir\n'
            'Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard '
            'is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take '
            'advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited '
            'to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the '
            'vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze '
            'that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding '
            'valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.\n'
            'Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, '
            'Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of '
            'earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. '
            'Biodynamics is not only good for the earth and good for the '
            'environment; it helps produce exceptional wine grapes.\n'

            'all be fermented together to increase complexity and depth of '

            'berries and fruits. The vineyard has been farmed to Biodynamic '

            'in 2005. We create our own compost for this vineyard as well as '

            'since 1903 and was listed on the National Register of Historic '
            'Places. As a young man, Gary worked on the family farm and was '
            'married to Sharon in 1982. In 1985 he began to focus more on the '
            'milling operation and in 1998 he completely took over the mill. '
            'Since then Gary has been carrying on and growing the family '
            'business. On December 27, 2011, two days after Christmas, Gary’s '
            'entire historic mill burned to the ground. With much '
            'encouragement from family, friends and business associates Gary '
            'rebuilt a new mill on the same site and struggled to rebuild his '
            'business.\n'
            'HOW THE PUZZLE FITS TOGETHER\n'
            'In the Fall of 2011 Lynda had an idea . . . what a great gift it '
            'would be to bring a Biodynamic Whole Wheat Flour into the world. '
            'And, as she shared this dream with her daughter, Jessica, the '
            'question arose, “What’s holding you back?” This simple question '
            'was the beginning of our journey to ISIS Biodynamic.\n'
            'Lynda began to seek out a stone-grinding flour mill and luckily, '
            'through a friend in the industry, was able to locate one. We '
            'needed a place to put it and thought of Gary back in Freeport '
            'trying to recover from the fire. We asked Gary if he would house '
            'the mill and make our flour. He agreed and the mill was '
            'installed, inspected and certified by the Demeter Association.\n'
            'Meanwhile Lynda and Jess had been making periodic visits to the '
            'Stone Barns Center for Agriculture in New York to see Fred '
            'Kirschenmann. We mentioned to Fred that we had purchased a mill '
            'and wanted to make Biodynamic® Whole Wheat Flour from his Wheat. '
            'Fred loved the idea and agreed to grow the Wheat for us.\n'
            'The rest is history, or should we say, the future! We are also '
            'delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Whole Foods '
            'Market team, and appreciate their dedication and support of '
            'providing Biodynamic® products nationwide.\n'

            'agriculture that strives to emulate a natural system. Fundamental '
            'to the success of our production system is the integration of '
            'animals for fertility and weed management, our selection of crops '
            'and cultivars for pest and disease control and our practice of '

            'blueberries through First Alternative Cooperative Grocery in '
            'Corvallis since 2005 and in the fall of 2009 began offering fall '
            'storage crops – potatoes, onions, garlic and winter squash direct '
            'for sale to consumers.  2012 marked our first year of real '
            'diversification – we grew a number of different vegetable crops '
            'and enjoyed the first fruits of our young orchard – apples, '
            'pears, and plums.  This foray into diversified market farming was '
            'rounded out by attending the Corvallis Farmers’ Markets where we '
            'provided organically grown, Demeter certified Biodynamic® food to '
            'our customers.  It was truly a pleasure to see new faces become '
            'familiar and to share the fruits of our labor.  In 2014 you will '
            'again see us at the market and we will also be offering a number '
            'of ways to support the farm – as a market member, farmstand '

 'profile': 'The George DeLallo Company was founded with the ideals of '
            'offering true authentic Italian foods with integrity and '
            'consistency. In the mid-1940s, Mr. George DeLallo began selling '
            'Italian grocery items door-to-door in the immigrant neighborhoods '
            'of Western Pennsylvania. In 1954, he and his wife Madeline '
            'established a grocery store in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, which '
            'specialized in authentic Italian foods. Soon after, they began to '
            'develop and sell traditional Italian products under the DeLallo '
            'name.\n'
            'As the years progressed, the retail and wholesale businesses '
            'grew. In the 1980s, DeLallo pioneered the olive and antipasti bar '
            'concept, which has become a staple of grocery stores around the '
            'U.S. and has revolutionized the American consumer’s experience of '
            'table olives and antipasti.\n'
            'Today, DeLallo’s original Jeannette retail store remains a '
            'vibrant and beloved part of the community and DeLallo products '
            'are distributed throughout the country. Whether it is found on '
            'traditional Italian grocery items such as olive oil, pasta, '
            'vinegars and tomatoes, or on our complete line of cured olives '
            'and antipasti, the DeLallo label guarantees consumers '
            'authenticity, integrity, and consistency.\n'
            'About Our Pasta\n'
            'At the heart of our Biodynamic Pasta is the wheat that is grown '
            'and harvested—under strict eco-safe values—in Southern Italy. '
            'Following generations of authentic Italian pasta-making, we '
            'utilize an authentic process. We begin with expertly milled '
            'semolina flour and cool, spring water, then extrude the dough '
            'with bronze dies. An artisanal method, extruding dough with '
            'bronze dies, creates a rougher surface making it easy to hug to '
            'your favorite sauces. The resulting pasta boasts that famous '
            'Italian fresh-bread flavor and al dente bite.\n'
            'About Our Olive Oil\n'
            'Grown and hand-harvested in lush orchards of Puglia, Italy, the '
            'olives that go into every bottle of our fresh, fruity '
            'extra-virgin olive oil are produced with the utmost care to the '
            'surrounding environment. Our Biodynamic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is '
            'created from the first, cold press of Italian-grown olives to '
            'maintain its rich olive flavor: robust and fruity with a light, '
            'peppery finish.',

            'in establishing the renowned Red Mountain American Viticultural '
            'Area.  Beginning as negociants selling their first Hedges branded '
            'Columbia Valley wine to the Swedish government, the Hedges '
            'quickly realized the importance of site for producing great '
            'wines, and purchased a fifty-acre parcel on the dusty southwest '
            'slope of Red Mountain, a barely known growing region at the time. '
            'More than two decades later, their now 125 acres of Red Mountain '
            'vineyard land is the heart of the Hedges family’s wines.  The '
            'eldest born of Tom and Anne-Marie, Christophe, is general manager '
            'and head of international sales.  Their daughter, Sarah, is the '

            'Farmers first, and winemakers second, the Hedges family believes '
            'there is nothing more important than expressing the '
            'characteristics of specific vineyards, of capturing Terroir.  '
            'Anne-Marie grew up in Champagne, France, and is no doubt the '
            'messenger of these beliefs, bringing the philosophies of the old '
            'world to her new home in eastern Washington State.  For more than '
            'a decade, the Hedges have chosen not to have their wines scored, '
            'as they believe this would hinder their pursuit of making wines '
            'of soul and truth.\n'

            'City, Ohio, offers clients a place to experience various '
            'activities centered within the calming and healing powers of the '
            'land. Services include massage therapy and other forms of '
            'bodywork, classes and retreats.\n'
            'In 2006 after decades of traditional farming practices we '
            'recognized the need to repair and heal the soil for future '
            'generations. We embarked on a transition to organic farming '
            'practices and in 2009 we received USDA/NOP organic certification '
            'and in 2012 our Biodynamic® certification. More than 500 lavender '
            'plants make up our foundation crop. In addition, we raise over 14 '
            'other herbs and each year we add to that diversity. The hay in '
            'the upper fields provides food for organic dairy cattle that '
            'pasture with us from a neighboring farm.\n'
            'Increasing the “life force” of the soil through the Biodynamic® '

            'and Biodynamic® cosmetic products and herbal supplements are the '
            'result of this “circle of life” that is part of Harmony Farm.\n'
            'Our product line includes over 30 certified Biodynamic® flower '
            'essences made from both cultivated and wild-crafted plants '
            'growing on the farm. These flower essences are the result of an '
            'energetic imprint of the flower on water, impacting our emotional '
            'issues and blockages on an energetic or vibrational level.\n'
            'Our lip balms and infused body oils are hand-crafted in small '

            'as osha root are made by extracting the plant material using '

            'Vineyard was purchased in 1987. An old turkey farm, the land '

            'sedimentary soils; to have both soil types in one vineyard is '
            'extremely unusual in the Willamette Valley. In places, the earth '
