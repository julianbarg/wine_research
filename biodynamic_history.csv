The site of Duemani is in essence the discovery of a new and promising winegrowing region which offers us  the elements we have searched for to make significant and exciting wines.  The structure of the soil is remarkable for its predominance of clay and stone â the resulting low soil fertility leading to greater character and complexity in our vineâs fruit. After an examination of the property and its unique position in the contour of a west-facing amphitheatre there emerged the sites of our three distinct vineyards.  The vineyard at the highest altitude and with the richest soil is the site of our Cabernet Franc vines.  Another lower vineyard continues with the same varietal and then evolves into rows of Merlot vines. The third and smallest vineyard, notably stony and arid, is the âheartâ of the estate and is planted to 7000 vines of alberello-trained Syrah.In June of 2005 we planted yet another hectare of vines that will bring the total figure to more than 7 hectares of high-density planted vineyards.
From the very beginning we have followed the principles of Biodynamic farming and since the 2004 harvest our estateâs production of grapes proudly carries the certification of organic and Demeter certified Biodynamic.",www.duemani.eu/

Seeing parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its environment became a key element of his approach.
This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the Brooks program from the beginning. âIf the vine is happy, the grapes simply taste better.â Jimi once said, âI believe that farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of terroir.â
The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a disservice to them to use any other farming method that would intrude on what the earth provides.
Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.
Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks Wine. Winemaker friends whoâd gathered at his memorial service compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimiâs philosophy. A dozen of Oregonâs top winemakers saw the 2004 vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimiâs assistant) became Head Winemaker; Jimiâs sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of Brooksâ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter farming.
Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooksâ story figured prominently in âAmerican Wine Story,â a film about inspiration and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and weâre been able to increase the number of outside vineyards weâre able to source grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout the process.
The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look forward to your stopping by when youâre in the area.

Sustainable agriculture had been the intersections of our passions and careers importing and distributing organic foods, however we'd never been farmers.
Our rural home was on 20 acres of land originally part of a larger farm established in the 1830s and abandoned following WWII. We have added neighboring acreage that was part of the original farm and today our family farm totals 80 acres located in New York State in Allegany county. We have an abundance of long forgotten old growth apple trees where we have cleared brush and thorns (multi floral rose, grrrrr!) to give them light and space. We've planted a small orchard with more apples, as well as peaches, cherries, apricots, and pears. We're in the process of establishing a vineyard. Recently we began to wild forage ramps and deliver to farm to fork restaurants in Manhattan and Brooklyn and leading retailers like Wegmans. This year we started to inoculate bolts of beech logs with mycelium to grow mushrooms. We have chickens and ducks and turkeys. We have raised pigs. We're learning more about cows and see their addition to the farm in the near future.
All parents worry about what they feed their kids. We felt a powerful impulse to nurture the land with and for them. We wanted to better understand what it meant to farm sustainably. We are learning as we go as a family, and increasingly our three children are leading projects around the farm. We participate in farmer trainings locally and attend Biodynamic Conferences to increase our understanding of farming to the Demeter standard. Sometimes it's difficult to separate play from work at the Yellow Barn Farm. We spend time together as a family, and we know our farmer!

Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and finally to Californiaâs Silicon Valley. After starting his own companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines held more interest for Barbara every day.
Biodiversity
Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard areas, providing weed control for us â and entertainment for the neighbors.
A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.
Energy Conservation
Puma Springsâ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system provides all hot water for the office.
Terroir
Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.
Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. Biodynamics is not only good for the earth and good for the environment; it helps produce exceptional wine grapes.

Hood Organic Farm,541-352-7492,,"Specialty varieties of apples and pears grown at the foot of Mt Hood in Oregon's Hood River Valley. Irrigated with glacial water and picked at the peak of ripeness, our 7 varieties of pears and 43 varieties of apples are known for their superior flavor. We pack and ship our own fruit, which is sold directly at our farm in the fall, at farmers markets, to CSA's and to wholesalers who distribute our fruit across the country. We will soon be shipping packed gift boxes as well.
Although the farm dates to the turn of the century (the main farmhouse was built in 1904), John and Brady Jacobson began working the orchards in 1981. Inspired by European techniques and committed to sustainable land use, the Jacobsons undertook an extensi\ve orchard renovation and transition to organic farming that resulted in full organic certification in 1989 - the first farm in the valley to achieve this status. Numerous publications from The Oregonian to the Good Fruit Grower have written articles about the farm, and the BBC and PBS have also interviewed and filmed here.
As better reflects their view of the importance of the integration of the natural landscape and wildlife into their farming practices, and returning to the deeper origins of the organic movement, Brady and John have now become BiodynamicÂ® growers. They also take pride in selling directly to loyal customers of the farm, as well as to regional markets, and donate a portion of their produce to School AidÂ®, a program in partnership with local markets and the Oregon Food Bank.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms is a unique, secluded, spectacular natural setting for hosting your one or two day weekend wedding retreat. Let your friends and families enjoy the most gorgeous mountain views (Mt Hood, Mt Adams & Mt Rainier) and gardens in the area and relax on our park-like grounds with orchards, fields, ponds, woods, and a lake. Lodging is available for up to six people in our Guest Cottage and Carriage House and maximum number of guests is 200.
The farm creates the feeling that for a day or two time has been stopped and rolled back to a different era. Unique and historic architecture in a magnificent setting coupled with fresh, organic, seasonal, farm-to-table dinners, prepared by our amazing chef make for a most memorable event. Dinners are served in our Apple House, a unique indoor/outdoor space with amazing views of Mt Hood, or on the lawn. Our staff is superb and the sense is one of family and connection.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms has been chosen twice as the Best Northwest Destination Wedding Site by Oregon Bride, and was designated this summer by MSN and The Knot as one of the most amazing wedding venues in the world. Our weddings have also been featured in numerous magazines and on blogs. You can also see more current information and photos from this season on Mt. Hood Organic Farms' Facebook page.

For more than ten years, Monique Camp has stewarded Sophiaâs Garden.   Her daily practice is three-fold: to ask what is needed, to listen, and then to take action. This was the way in which Sophiaâs Garden was set in motion and how it continues to evolve.
In addition to offering Biodynamic Hydrosols, Essential Oils and dried medicinal herbs, this is a healing, teaching garden. We serve the greater community by establishing a demonstration and model garden/farm.  We offer classes and events to teach about the practices of Biodynamic Agriculture as a path for healing the earth and ourselves.

On the 10-acre property there are 7.5 acres planted to Pinot Noir grapes with the remaining acreage set aside for gardens. Within the gardens still remain a few hazelnut trees keeping the legacy alive. The Dundee Hills were formed between 6 and 17 million years ago by the Columbia River lava flows that made its way from the Oregon-Idaho border all the way to the coast. The lava solidified to form basalt. Over the years the rock weathered away in the high rainfalls of the Willamette Valley to form deep red clay soils. These volcanic soils are exceptionally good for growing grapes, particularly Pinot Noir.

Our wines are inspired. We believe Oregon is a special place to make wine and we believe in our vineyards. We admire Burgundy, but we are not French and neither are our wines. We are not certain why we do everything we do, we can only say with confidence that we love wine and feel compelled to be involved.  The work of others in this field inspires us to continue our journey to produce Oregonian wines. In return we hope to inspire others with our work.
Rather than striving for a stylistic preference, we seek balance and energy in our wines. This energy is a mystery to us and we seek to understand and harness it. Our observations lead us to believe this energy exists in wines that are made from organic fruit sources combined with wild fermentations and minimal intervention. For this reason we farm our vineyards and craft our wines using organic and BiodynamicÂ® methods.
We are educated in Enology, Viticulture, and International Business. Our training is used as a tool when needed. We work with determination, integrating our experience into the vineyard and winery to achieve harmony. Our method of work is largely philosophically based. Our decisions are guided by both instinct and observation. We believe that diversity in the biological ecosystem of the vineyard and winery is essential to achieve a true expression of terroir in wine.
Terroir is our guiding principle. We believe in letting nature take its course, but also view the dynamic of a vineyard and winery as being something that requires human involvement to form a unified system. Our goal is to understand and sustain the unity of this system in order to create original and compelling wines with a distinct sense of place. Our place is Johan Vineyards.

Lyndaâs first trip to the Northern Plains in 1982 resulted in her total dedication to the organic industry. For the past 30+ years Lynda has been working to supply domestic and export markets with organic and biodynamicÂ® products. These efforts have supported not only the Northern Plains Sustainable Agricultural Society, that started as a small group of 35 farmers and since has grown to almost 600, but also many other organic farmers outside the group.
Jessica Rockwell joined the ISIS Biodynamic portion of the company in 2012. Jessica had grown up around the organic âbuzzâ at home and as an adult has come to realize the health and overall benefits of the organic lifestyle. A recent university graduate with a Bachelorâs degree in Marketing and an Associates degree in Merchandising, Jessica brings much knowledge, skill and enthusiasm to the business.
OUR BIODYNAMIC FARMER
Our farmer, Fred Kirschenmann, converted to BiodynamicÂ® farming from organic farming in 1982. His farm, just West of the James River in North Dakota, has been certified Biodynamic by theâ¨DemeterÂ® Association for over 31 years! Not only has Fred been a dedicated BiodynamicÂ® farmer, but he has also been a strong public and private advocate of organic farming â working with universities, extension agencies, local and federal government agencies and many others to further the growth of organic farming locally and nationwide. He has written many publications, books and hundreds of speeches in support of soil building and other farming practices that the organic and BiodynamicÂ® farms embrace.
OUR MILLER
Our miller is Gary Thelen of Freeport, Minnesota. Gary is a third generation miller who took over the 100+ year old historic flour mill from his father, Walter. The mill has been in his family since 1903 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a young man, Gary worked on the family farm and was married to Sharon in 1982. In 1985 he began to focus more on the milling operation and in 1998 he completely took over the mill. Since then Gary has been carrying on and growing the family business. On December 27, 2011, two days after Christmas, Garyâs entire historic mill burned to the ground. With much encouragement from family, friends and business associates Gary rebuilt a new mill on the same site and struggled to rebuild his business.
HOW THE PUZZLE FITS TOGETHER
In the Fall of 2011 Lynda had an idea . . . what a great gift it would be to bring a Biodynamic Whole Wheat Flour into the world. And, as she shared this dream with her daughter, Jessica, the question arose, âWhatâs holding you back?â This simple question was the beginning of our journey to ISIS Biodynamic.
Lynda began to seek out a stone-grinding flour mill and luckily, through a friend in the industry, was able to locate one. We needed a place to put it and thought of Gary back in Freeport trying to recover from the fire. We asked Gary if he would house the mill and make our flour. He agreed and the mill was installed, inspected and certified by the Demeter Association.
Meanwhile Lynda and Jess had been making periodic visits to the Stone Barns Center for Agriculture in New York to see Fred Kirschenmann. We mentioned to Fred that we had purchased a mill and wanted to make BiodynamicÂ® Whole Wheat Flour from his Wheat. Fred loved the idea and agreed to grow the Wheat for us.
The rest is history, or should we say, the future! We are also delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Whole Foods Market team, and appreciate their dedication and support of providing BiodynamicÂ® products nationwide.
We truly hope ISIS BiodynamicÂ® brings something delicious and fruitful to your kitchen and life!",www.isisbiodynamic.com

The farm has been Demeter certified BiodynamicÂ® and Oregon Tilth certified Organic since 1987.
Over the years we have produced various berry crops (raspberries, strawberries, blackberries). Currently the farm produces numerous blackberry varieties and the production is processed on-farm generating a unique, award winning True Blackberry Vinegar. Our fruit production also is marketed as both fresh and frozen wholesale to processors and retailers.
In addition to producing the berries, the farm has always produced a range of medicinal herb crops  that rotate through the acreage, including the berry plantings. We have 2 commercial scale driers on-farm that dry herbs to order. Medicinal herbs are offered bulk wholesale both as fresh and dried.
The integration of the herb production with the production of fruit inspired the development of a unique Low Tillage Weed Control and Fertility System at Hoskins Berry Farm. Initiated by a Western SARE grant in the early 1990's the farm developed a ""mow and blow"" system where bulk organic materials are grown between the crop rows and then cut and blown into the crop row. This system has become the foundation of generating fertility on the farm and also serves as a primary on-farm source of weed control and water conservation.
Hoskins Berry Farm also supports (and is supported by) a herd of bright eyed Scottish Highland cattle, the off spring from which now adorn Biodynamic farms throughout the United States.

Our mission is to provide unconventionally grown food for the people of our local community. To us, unconventionally grown means we take a systems approach in our efforts to balance our food production with our responsibility for our local forest, field and river life and with the health of our planet. We work hard to minimum our use of off-farm and petroleum dependent inputs and practice a method of agriculture that strives to emulate a natural system. Fundamental to the success of our production system is the integration of animals for fertility and weed management, our selection of crops and cultivars for pest and disease control and our practice of âfarmscapingâ which provides habitat for native pollinators and natural predators of pests. We are Demeter Certified BiodynamicÂ® as well as certified organic by Stellar Certification Services.
We are currently expanding our operations to provide a diversity of vegetable and fruit crops.  We have been selling our blueberries through First Alternative Cooperative Grocery in Corvallis since 2005 and in the fall of 2009 began offering fall storage crops â potatoes, onions, garlic and winter squash direct for sale to consumers.  2012 marked our first year of real diversification â we grew a number of different vegetable crops and enjoyed the first fruits of our young orchard â apples, pears, and plums.  This foray into diversified market farming was rounded out by attending the Corvallis Farmersâ Markets where we provided organically grown, Demeter certified BiodynamicÂ® food to our customers.  It was truly a pleasure to see new faces become familiar and to share the fruits of our labor.  In 2014 you will again see us at the market and we will also be offering a number of ways to support the farm â as a market member, farmstand share, or box subscription.

Inc.,(800) 433-9100,"Pasta,Wheat Pasta","The George DeLallo Company was founded with the ideals of offering true authentic Italian foods with integrity and consistency. In the mid-1940s, Mr. George DeLallo began selling Italian grocery items door-to-door in the immigrant neighborhoods of Western Pennsylvania. In 1954, he and his wife Madeline established a grocery store in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, which specialized in authentic Italian foods. Soon after, they began to develop and sell traditional Italian products under the DeLallo name.
As the years progressed, the retail and wholesale businesses grew. In the 1980s, DeLallo pioneered the olive and antipasti bar concept, which has become a staple of grocery stores around the U.S. and has revolutionized the American consumerâs experience of table olives and antipasti.
Today, DeLalloâs original Jeannette retail store remains a vibrant and beloved part of the community and DeLallo products are distributed throughout the country. Whether it is found on traditional Italian grocery items such as olive oil, pasta, vinegars and tomatoes, or on our complete line of cured olives and antipasti, the DeLallo label guarantees consumers authenticity, integrity, and consistency.
About Our Pasta
At the heart of our Biodynamic Pasta is the wheat that is grown and harvestedâunder strict eco-safe valuesâin Southern Italy. Following generations of authentic Italian pasta-making, we utilize an authentic process. We begin with expertly milled semolina flour and cool, spring water, then extrude the dough with bronze dies. An artisanal method, extruding dough with bronze dies, creates a rougher surface making it easy to hug to your favorite sauces. The resulting pasta boasts that famous Italian fresh-bread flavor and al dente bite.
About Our Olive Oil
Grown and hand-harvested in lush orchards of Puglia, Italy, the olives that go into every bottle of our fresh, fruity extra-virgin olive oil are produced with the utmost care to the surrounding environment. Our Biodynamic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is created from the first, cold press of Italian-grown olives to maintain its rich olive flavor: robust and fruity with a light, peppery finish.",

Beginning as negociants selling their first Hedges branded Columbia Valley wine to the Swedish government, the Hedges quickly realized the importance of site for producing great wines, and purchased a fifty-acre parcel on the dusty southwest slope of Red Mountain, a barely known growing region at the time. More than two decades later, their now 125 acres of Red Mountain vineyard land is the heart of the Hedges familyâs wines.  The eldest born of Tom and Anne-Marie, Christophe, is general manager and head of international sales.  Their daughter, Sarah, is the head winemaker.
Farmers first, and winemakers second, the Hedges family believes there is nothing more important than expressing the characteristics of specific vineyards, of capturing Terroir.  Anne-Marie grew up in Champagne, France, and is no doubt the messenger of these beliefs, bringing the philosophies of the old world to her new home in eastern Washington State.  For more than a decade, the Hedges have chosen not to have their wines scored, as they believe this would hinder their pursuit of making wines of soul and truth.

Our ranch is rugged and suited to vineyards, aromatic plants, trees, and goats (our compost makers).
We began using Biodynamic techniques in our farming in 1999 because our vines were weak and our grapes, not ripening.  Not only did our grapes ripen, but we increased production by 90%. The health of our soil has improved so much we barely irrigate the vines.
We grow chardonnay grapes as well as lavender, rosemary, rose geranium, helichrysum italicum and are excitedly awaiting our first bumper crop of fuyu persimmons. Most of our lavender is Grosso, a lavendin, a hybrid of spike lavender and English lavender. It has about 16 times the amount of oil as true English lavender, which makes it ideal for dried flowers. We are experimenting with an English lavender developed in Oregon, Buena Vista, to see how it survives our winters. We dry some of the lavender and Donald estate distills the aromatics. We sell the hydrosols to small cosmetic makers as well as wholesale to local stores and we have a store on the internet. Once a year when the lavender is in full bloom we have an Open House, which we announce on our website. (2014 we are taking a break due to replanting of significant amounts of lavender.)

Located on a warm southeast facing slope of the Chehalem Ridge, fruit at this vineyard is harvested a week or two before other REX HILL Pinot Noir sites. This beautiful vineyard offers both volcanic and sedimentary soils; to have both soil types in one vineyard is extremely unusual in the Willamette Valley.

This helps retain good acidity and balance in the fruit we grow in the volcanic, shallow soils of the area.
Our story begins in 1989 when Craig and Gabriele Keeler were searching for properties to begin a new chapter in their lives and decided to take a walk through a picturesque hillside in Amity, Oregon. When Gabriele saw, on this long time abandoned, overgrown with blackberries, piece of land, the view to the south with views of Mary's Peak and Oregon's coastal mountains she grabbed Craig's hand and said ""CK, this is the place!"".  In 1990 the Keeler family moved to their 200 acre property and through many years of hard work they transformed what was once fields of blackberry's, rocky terrain and dilapidated structures to what is today; a home and Keeler Estate Vineyard.  It's a truly magical place consisting of a thriving biodynamic vineyard, gardens, forest, lakes, streams, acres of landscaping and plenty room for entertaining.

Light of Day Organic Farm and Tea Shop is a Northern Michigan company, located in gorgeous Leelanau County, just 8 miles West of historic downtown Traverse City. We are 8 miles from Lake Michigan, and are on the direct route (M-72 West) to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Our address is: 3502 E. Traverse Hwy. Traverse City, Michigan. Please visit our âHours of Operationâ page for seasonal visiting hours.
Our story
Light of Day Organics was founded by a Traverse City Mom named Angela Macke in 2003. Her background in Holistic health, (as both a Registered Nurse, Educator, and Horticulturalist), plus her own positive experience utilizing gentle, natural rhythms to successfully manage an auto-immune disease, plays an integral role in the thoughtful creation of each original product. Around here, we believe that a holistic approach is the most effective way to restore optimal health and a sense of well being. Helping our customers to create healthy lifestyle habits that support the prevention of illness, increase overall vitality, passion for life, and supporting the path to full actualization of  our full potential as human beings is our daily practice and intentional goal of our work.
Our Farm and production
Our products are Certified Organic and the Lionâs share (57%)  are grown right here on our certified Demeter Biodynamic farm in Traverse City under the guidelines of the National Organic Program, and Demeter U.S. The exceptionally high quality botanicals are hand-harvested, dried in our licensed commercial farm kitchen, then finish blended in small batches by hand to promote consistency, to maximize freshness and with the intention of offering them to you in their most pristine state. We hope that you enjoy the maximal nutritive benefits as Mother Nature intended.
Certifications and Process
We believe in honest tea and honest advertising here. This means supporting local and foreign farmers through certified (third-party verified, which includes annual audits) Fair Trade certified practices (Transfair USA) , growing and buying only 100% certified Organic (Stellar certification services and Demeter Biodynamic)  agricultural commodities.  Our teas and tisanes are Gluten-free.
Conscientious Packaging
We believe in presenting these products in their most natural, loose form. They have been packaged in lovely, domestically-manufactured, polished silver tins to protect them from the elements. We used a local designer, and local printer for soy-based ink labels and other packaging needs using Earth-friendly sustainable materials. We hand blend to completion in small batches, then package and label our teas right here in our farm kitchen.
Quality of Product / Quality of Life
We wanted to make sure that taste wasnât the only thing to feel good about. Ensuring the highest quality of tea for you and life for those who bring it to us is part of our mission. We honor all of those involved in bringing this extremely labor-intensive crop from the fields to our cup by paying everyone a proper living wage and encouraging the spiritual sacredness of the family unit and community with time off from work to recharge and to play in this beautiful area that we are blessed to call âhomeâ.
It is Light of Dayâs sincere intention that you may enjoy balance and reach your full potential as a human being! We want for everyone to enjoy superb health, inner peace, joyfulness, and be on a well-lit path that will benefit the greater good with all that you do. We hope that you will discover, (and hopefully learn to cherish), the ancient and life-giving ritual of having a âspot of tea.â
For all of us here at Light of Day, tea is so more than an iced beverage to soothe your thirst in the Summertime, or to comfort your sore throat in the Wintertime.  We have come to appreciate that the commitment to daily self care  by taking time out to enjoy tea is a representative of the commitment and conscious choice  to live simply, and to live each day with a wonder and deep reverence for every created thing.
We really appreciate you taking the time to learn about us, and hope that you'll visit our Press Page to watch a PBS special where we were featured, ad well as read other good press.
Thank you.

We believe in three things: growing great food, crafting fine spirits, and taking care of the earth. Really, we donât think that the first two are possible without the latter.
Many of our BiodynamicÂ® practices are a return to age-old farming methods. We make our own compost and preparations (homeopathic plant materials that stimulate plant growth and health), and we grow a diverse range of fruit and vegetables that thrive in the 12-month-a-year growing season of the Central Valley. Our commitment to BiodynamicÂ® farming involves a spiritual component and some serious elbow grease. We also use BiodynamicÂ® inspired Festival sprays to honor the earth that supports us.
We make our BiodynamicÂ® and organic spirits in small batches using traditional copper-pot distillation. Our spirits are available for purchase on our website, along with raisins, almonds, and citrus (when in season).

We strive to preserve the nutritive value and vitality of every ingredient in our organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, low glycemic, kosher, raw, vegan/vegetarian, healthy and natural products. Many of our methodologies and formulations are entirely exclusive to the company.
We are mindful of where and how our ingredients are produced, closely monitor production methods, and recognize the impact of our business practices on the people we encounter, the lifestyles we influence, and the preservation of our planet. Omica Organics does not purchase products or ingredients on the common market, but works closely with growers and processors in the US and around the world to offer the best products in ways that promote health, sustainability, and eco-awareness. We are passionate about paying fair wages and prices, maintaining honesty and responsibility, and promoting respect and goodwill in our endeavors.
Omica Organics is directly associated with Sophiaâs Gardens in Sebastopol, California, a biodynamically-run farm that grows for our company, and who researches and archives information on biodynamic farming techniques. Sophiaâs Gardens is a single-family owned farm where crops are picked by hand and processed manually using age-old techniques that preserve the goodness of the plant. Our founderâs involvement with Anthroposophic research, biodynamic farming and water-flow technology (based on Rudolph Steiner and Viktor Schaubergerâs works) spans 38+ years.
We contract with local farmers and ensure that they follow organic methodologies. We promote and buy organic only, inspiring farmers to follow organic practices, and encouraging manufacturers to promote organic farmers and farming techniques through economic need and markets. This not only supports farmers in the US, but helps to support an organic standard of industry in India and China. We purchase only from these organic farmers, then process without using synthetic solvents. We have partners on-site in these countries to verify adherence to strict organic standards.
Our proprietary stevia is cultivated from an extensive network of family-owned stevia farms. Self-sustaining farming methods help preserve the naturally-beneficial phytochemicals of the stevia leaf. The stevia leaves are picked by hand at the peak of the growing season, then dried naturally using sunlight and fresh air. The support we provide helps to keep these historically significant farming practices from disappearing completely.
We use no fillers or artificial ingredients and all capsules are non-gelatin vegetarian. No synthetic preservatives are found in our products. We use organic vegetable glycerin (made fresh specifically for our use; and not sourced from industrial byproducts) along with organic biodynamic grape alcohol to preserve our products when necessary.
We endeavor to uphold eco-friendly office and shipping practices. For instance, the popcorn used in our shipping packaging is a biodegradable cornstarch product that breaks down completely within 2 months. Our paperless practices preserve trees, we print on the backs of used paper whenever feasible, and we recycle everything possible including shredded documents, food and drink containers, and toner/ink cartridges.  One of our US offices, located in an appropriately sunny climate, is completely solar powered, helping to reduce ozone emissions, and save trees that produce life-giving oxygen.
Omica Organics is proud to offer superior products while promoting the good of our planet and we who share it.",OmicaOrganics.com
