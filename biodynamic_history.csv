Seeing parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its environment became a key element of his approach.
This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the Brooks program from the beginning. “If the vine is happy, the grapes simply taste better.” Jimi once said, “I believe that farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of terroir.”
The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a disservice to them to use any other farming method that would intrude on what the earth provides.
Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.
Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks Wine. Winemaker friends who’d gathered at his memorial service compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimi’s philosophy. A dozen of Oregon’s top winemakers saw the 2004 vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimi’s assistant) became Head Winemaker; Jimi’s sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of Brooks’ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter farming.
Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooks’ story figured prominently in “American Wine Story,” a film about inspiration and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and we’re been able to increase the number of outside vineyards we’re able to source grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout the process.
The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look forward to your stopping by when you’re in the area.

Irrigated with glacial water and picked at the peak of ripeness, our 7 varieties of pears and 43 varieties of apples are known for their superior flavor. We pack and ship our own fruit, which is sold directly at our farm in the fall, at farmers markets, to CSA's and to wholesalers who distribute our fruit across the country. We will soon be shipping packed gift boxes as well.
Although the farm dates to the turn of the century (the main farmhouse was built in 1904), John and Brady Jacobson began working the orchards in 1981. Inspired by European techniques and committed to sustainable land use, the Jacobsons undertook an extensi\ve orchard renovation and transition to organic farming that resulted in full organic certification in 1989 - the first farm in the valley to achieve this status. Numerous publications from The Oregonian to the Good Fruit Grower have written articles about the farm, and the BBC and PBS have also interviewed and filmed here.
As better reflects their view of the importance of the integration of the natural landscape and wildlife into their farming practices, and returning to the deeper origins of the organic movement, Brady and John have now become Biodynamic® growers. They also take pride in selling directly to loyal customers of the farm, as well as to regional markets, and donate a portion of their produce to School Aid®, a program in partnership with local markets and the Oregon Food Bank.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms is a unique, secluded, spectacular natural setting for hosting your one or two day weekend wedding retreat. Let your friends and families enjoy the most gorgeous mountain views (Mt Hood, Mt Adams & Mt Rainier) and gardens in the area and relax on our park-like grounds with orchards, fields, ponds, woods, and a lake. Lodging is available for up to six people in our Guest Cottage and Carriage House and maximum number of guests is 200.
The farm creates the feeling that for a day or two time has been stopped and rolled back to a different era. Unique and historic architecture in a magnificent setting coupled with fresh, organic, seasonal, farm-to-table dinners, prepared by our amazing chef make for a most memorable event. Dinners are served in our Apple House, a unique indoor/outdoor space with amazing views of Mt Hood, or on the lawn. Our staff is superb and the sense is one of family and connection.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms has been chosen twice as the Best Northwest Destination Wedding Site by Oregon Bride, and was designated this summer by MSN and The Knot as one of the most amazing wedding venues in the world.

Our wines are inspired. We believe Oregon is a special place to make wine and we believe in our vineyards. We admire Burgundy, but we are not French and neither are our wines. We are not certain why we do everything we do, we can only say with confidence that we love wine and feel compelled to be involved.  The work of others in this field inspires us to continue our journey to produce Oregonian wines. In return we hope to inspire others with our work.
Rather than striving for a stylistic preference, we seek balance and energy in our wines. This energy is a mystery to us and we seek to understand and harness it. Our observations lead us to believe this energy exists in wines that are made from organic fruit sources combined with wild fermentations and minimal intervention. For this reason we farm our vineyards and craft our wines using organic and Biodynamic® methods.
We are educated in Enology, Viticulture, and International Business. Our training is used as a tool when needed. We work with determination, integrating our experience into the vineyard and winery to achieve harmony. Our method of work is largely philosophically based. Our decisions are guided by both instinct and observation. We believe that diversity in the biological ecosystem of the vineyard and winery is essential to achieve a true expression of terroir in wine.
Terroir is our guiding principle. We believe in letting nature take its course, but also view the dynamic of a vineyard and winery as being something that requires human involvement to form a unified system. Our goal is to understand and sustain the unity of this system in order to create original and compelling wines with a distinct sense of place. Our place is Johan Vineyards.

Lynda’s first trip to the Northern Plains in 1982 resulted in her total dedication to the organic industry. For the past 30+ years Lynda has been working to supply domestic and export markets with organic and biodynamic® products. These efforts have supported not only the Northern Plains Sustainable Agricultural Society, that started as a small group of 35 farmers and since has grown to almost 600, but also many other organic farmers outside the group.
Jessica Rockwell joined the ISIS Biodynamic portion of the company in 2012. Jessica had grown up around the organic “buzz” at home and as an adult has come to realize the health and overall benefits of the organic lifestyle. A recent university graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing and an Associates degree in Merchandising, Jessica brings much knowledge, skill and enthusiasm to the business.
OUR BIODYNAMIC FARMER
Our farmer, Fred Kirschenmann, converted to Biodynamic® farming from organic farming in 1982. His farm, just West of the James River in North Dakota, has been certified Biodynamic by the Demeter® Association for over 31 years! Not only has Fred been a dedicated Biodynamic® farmer, but he has also been a strong public and private advocate of organic farming – working with universities, extension agencies, local and federal government agencies and many others to further the growth of organic farming locally and nationwide. He has written many publications, books and hundreds of speeches in support of soil building and other farming practices that the organic and Biodynamic® farms embrace.
OUR MILLER
Our miller is Gary Thelen of Freeport, Minnesota. Gary is a third generation miller who took over the 100+ year old historic flour mill from his father, Walter. The mill has been in his family since 1903 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a young man, Gary worked on the family farm and was married to Sharon in 1982. In 1985 he began to focus more on the milling operation and in 1998 he completely took over the mill. Since then Gary has been carrying on and growing the family business. On December 27, 2011, two days after Christmas, Gary’s entire historic mill burned to the ground. With much encouragement from family, friends and business associates Gary rebuilt a new mill on the same site and struggled to rebuild his business.
HOW THE PUZZLE FITS TOGETHER
In the Fall of 2011 Lynda had an idea . . . what a great gift it would be to bring a Biodynamic Whole Wheat Flour into the world. And, as she shared this dream with her daughter, Jessica, the question arose, “What’s holding you back?” This simple question was the beginning of our journey to ISIS Biodynamic.
Lynda began to seek out a stone-grinding flour mill and luckily, through a friend in the industry, was able to locate one. We needed a place to put it and thought of Gary back in Freeport trying to recover from the fire. We asked Gary if he would house the mill and make our flour. He agreed and the mill was installed, inspected and certified by the Demeter Association.
Meanwhile Lynda and Jess had been making periodic visits to the Stone Barns Center for Agriculture in New York to see Fred Kirschenmann. We mentioned to Fred that we had purchased a mill and wanted to make Biodynamic® Whole Wheat Flour from his Wheat. Fred loved the idea and agreed to grow the Wheat for us.
The rest is history, or should we say, the future! We are also delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Whole Foods Market team, and appreciate their dedication and support of providing Biodynamic® products nationwide.

Currently the farm produces numerous blackberry varieties and the production is processed on-farm generating a unique, award winning True Blackberry Vinegar. Our fruit production also is marketed as both fresh and frozen wholesale to processors and retailers.
In addition to producing the berries, the farm has always produced a range of medicinal herb crops  that rotate through the acreage, including the berry plantings. We have 2 commercial scale driers on-farm that dry herbs to order. Medicinal herbs are offered bulk wholesale both as fresh and dried.
The integration of the herb production with the production of fruit inspired the development of a unique Low Tillage Weed Control and Fertility System at Hoskins Berry Farm. Initiated by a Western SARE grant in the early 1990's the farm developed a ""mow and blow"" system where bulk organic materials are grown between the crop rows and then cut and blown into the crop row. This system has become the foundation of generating fertility on the farm and also serves as a primary on-farm source of weed control and water conservation.
Hoskins Berry Farm also supports (and is supported by) a herd of bright eyed Scottish Highland cattle, the off spring from which now adorn Biodynamic farms throughout the United States.

The vineyard at the highest altitude and with the richest soil is the site of our Cabernet Franc vines.
