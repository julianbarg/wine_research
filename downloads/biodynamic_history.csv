Protected by the Palisades Mountains to the north and cooled by westerly breezes, this 38-acre vineyard is planted on well-drained cobbly soils that produce a low yielding crop of exceptionally concentrated fruit.  Since 1998 we have been committed to farming organically and since 2000 we have employed Biodynamic principles.  For vineyard preparations we grow valerian, horsetail, chamomile, stinging nettles, yarrow and willow, and on our surrounding 120 oak woodland acres we raise Scottish Highland cattle and keep bees.

Protected by the Palisades Mountains to the north and cooled by westerly breezes, this 38-acre vineyard is planted on well-drained cobbly soils that produce a low yielding crop of exceptionally concentrated fruit.  Since 1998 we have been committed to farming organically and since 2000 we have employed Biodynamic principles.  For vineyard preparations we grow valerian, horsetail, chamomile, stinging nettles, yarrow and willow, and on our surrounding 120 oak woodland acres we raise Scottish Highland cattle and keep bees.

Grimmâs Bluff itself is a dedication to quality, heritage, and place. Founded by Rick and Aurora Grimm in 2010, Grimmâs Bluff was built with the intention of making premium wine through the respect of time and process. Sitting 300 ft above the Santa Ynez riverbed, the Estate consists of 16.5 acres of Demeter certified, biodynamically farmed Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Petit Verdot. With the guidance of Paul Lato as head winemaker, the wines produced are a tribute to the old world with both their character and finesse.

In the mid-1940s, Mr. George DeLallo began selling Italian grocery items door-to-door in the immigrant neighborhoods of Western Pennsylvania. In 1954, he and his wife Madeline established a grocery store in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, which specialized in authentic Italian foods. Soon after, they began to develop and sell traditional Italian products under the DeLallo name.
As the years progressed, the retail and wholesale businesses grew. In the 1980s, DeLallo pioneered the olive and antipasti bar concept, which has become a staple of grocery stores around the U.S. and has revolutionized the American consumerâs experience of table olives and antipasti.
Today, DeLalloâs original Jeannette retail store remains a vibrant and beloved part of the community and DeLallo products are distributed throughout the country. Whether it is found on traditional Italian grocery items such as olive oil, pasta, vinegars and tomatoes, or on our complete line of cured olives and antipasti, the DeLallo label guarantees consumers authenticity, integrity, and consistency.
About Our Pasta
At the heart of our Biodynamic Pasta is the wheat that is grown and harvestedâunder strict eco-safe valuesâin Southern Italy. Following generations of authentic Italian pasta-making, we utilize an authentic process. We begin with expertly milled semolina flour and cool, spring water, then extrude the dough with bronze dies. An artisanal method, extruding dough with bronze dies, creates a rougher surface making it easy to hug to your favorite sauces. The resulting pasta boasts that famous Italian fresh-bread flavor and al dente bite.
About Our Olive Oil
Grown and hand-harvested in lush orchards of Puglia, Italy, the olives that go into every bottle of our fresh, fruity extra-virgin olive oil are produced with the utmost care to the surrounding environment. Our Biodynamic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is created from the first, cold press of Italian-grown olives to maintain its rich olive flavor: robust and fruity with a light, peppery finish.",PA,,,

Inc.,(800) 433-9100,"Pasta,Wheat Pasta","The George DeLallo Company was founded with the ideals of offering true authentic Italian foods with integrity and consistency. In the mid-1940s, Mr. George DeLallo began selling Italian grocery items door-to-door in the immigrant neighborhoods of Western Pennsylvania. In 1954, he and his wife Madeline established a grocery store in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, which specialized in authentic Italian foods. Soon after, they began to develop and sell traditional Italian products under the DeLallo name.
As the years progressed, the retail and wholesale businesses grew. In the 1980s, DeLallo pioneered the olive and antipasti bar concept, which has become a staple of grocery stores around the U.S. and has revolutionized the American consumerâs experience of table olives and antipasti.
Today, DeLalloâs original Jeannette retail store remains a vibrant and beloved part of the community and DeLallo products are distributed throughout the country. Whether it is found on traditional Italian grocery items such as olive oil, pasta, vinegars and tomatoes, or on our complete line of cured olives and antipasti, the DeLallo label guarantees consumers authenticity, integrity, and consistency.
About Our Pasta
At the heart of our Biodynamic Pasta is the wheat that is grown and harvestedâunder strict eco-safe valuesâin Southern Italy. Following generations of authentic Italian pasta-making, we utilize an authentic process. We begin with expertly milled semolina flour and cool, spring water, then extrude the dough with bronze dies. An artisanal method, extruding dough with bronze dies, creates a rougher surface making it easy to hug to your favorite sauces. The resulting pasta boasts that famous Italian fresh-bread flavor and al dente bite.
About Our Olive Oil
Grown and hand-harvested in lush orchards of Puglia, Italy, the olives that go into every bottle of our fresh, fruity extra-virgin olive oil are produced with the utmost care to the surrounding environment. Our Biodynamic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is created from the first, cold press of Italian-grown olives to maintain its rich olive flavor: robust and fruity with a light, peppery finish.",PA,,,

Currently the farm produces numerous blackberry varieties and the production is processed on-farm generating a unique, award winning True Blackberry Vinegar. Our fruit production also is marketed as both fresh and frozen wholesale to processors and retailers.
In addition to producing the berries, the farm has always produced a range of medicinal herb crops  that rotate through the acreage, including the berry plantings. We have 2 commercial scale driers on-farm that dry herbs to order. Medicinal herbs are offered bulk wholesale both as fresh and dried.
The integration of the herb production with the production of fruit inspired the development of a unique Low Tillage Weed Control and Fertility System at Hoskins Berry Farm. Initiated by a Western SARE grant in the early 1990's the farm developed a ""mow and blow"" system where bulk organic materials are grown between the crop rows and then cut and blown into the crop row. This system has become the foundation of generating fertility on the farm and also serves as a primary on-farm source of weed control and water conservation.
Hoskins Berry Farm also supports (and is supported by) a herd of bright eyed Scottish Highland cattle, the off spring from which now adorn Biodynamic farms throughout the United States.

Hood Organic Farm,541-352-7492,,"Specialty varieties of apples and pears grown at the foot of Mt Hood in Oregon's Hood River Valley. Irrigated with glacial water and picked at the peak of ripeness, our 7 varieties of pears and 43 varieties of apples are known for their superior flavor. We pack and ship our own fruit, which is sold directly at our farm in the fall, at farmers markets, to CSA's and to wholesalers who distribute our fruit across the country. We will soon be shipping packed gift boxes as well.
Although the farm dates to the turn of the century (the main farmhouse was built in 1904), John and Brady Jacobson began working the orchards in 1981. Inspired by European techniques and committed to sustainable land use, the Jacobsons undertook an extensi\ve orchard renovation and transition to organic farming that resulted in full organic certification in 1989 - the first farm in the valley to achieve this status. Numerous publications from The Oregonian to the Good Fruit Grower have written articles about the farm, and the BBC and PBS have also interviewed and filmed here.
As better reflects their view of the importance of the integration of the natural landscape and wildlife into their farming practices, and returning to the deeper origins of the organic movement, Brady and John have now become BiodynamicÂ® growers. They also take pride in selling directly to loyal customers of the farm, as well as to regional markets, and donate a portion of their produce to School AidÂ®, a program in partnership with local markets and the Oregon Food Bank.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms is a unique, secluded, spectacular natural setting for hosting your one or two day weekend wedding retreat. Let your friends and families enjoy the most gorgeous mountain views (Mt Hood, Mt Adams & Mt Rainier) and gardens in the area and relax on our park-like grounds with orchards, fields, ponds, woods, and a lake. Lodging is available for up to six people in our Guest Cottage and Carriage House and maximum number of guests is 200.
The farm creates the feeling that for a day or two time has been stopped and rolled back to a different era. Unique and historic architecture in a magnificent setting coupled with fresh, organic, seasonal, farm-to-table dinners, prepared by our amazing chef make for a most memorable event. Dinners are served in our Apple House, a unique indoor/outdoor space with amazing views of Mt Hood, or on the lawn. Our staff is superb and the sense is one of family and connection.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms has been chosen twice as the Best Northwest Destination Wedding Site by Oregon Bride, and was designated this summer by MSN and The Knot as one of the most amazing wedding venues in the world. Our weddings have also been featured in numerous magazines and on blogs. You can also see more current information and photos from this season on Mt. Hood Organic Farms' Facebook page.

With a 200-acre Demeter Certified BiodynamicÂ® and Stellar Certified Organic vineyard located in north Willamette Valley in Oregon, we focus on producing superior Pinot Noirs, cool climate whites, and fascinating Italian varietals.
President and Chief Viticulturist, Rudy Marchesi, side-by-side with Head Winemaker, Stephen Webber, and General Manager and daughter, Kristin Marchesi, work closely to shepherd grapes through the evolution from fruit to wine.
By employing thoughtful BiodynamicÂ® and organic growing practices and utmost care in winemaking, the quality of the vineyards is reflected in the grapes and then in the wine.
The majority of grapes used in our wines come from our home estate vineyard. Planted in 1982, Montinore Estate is a 200-acre Demeter Certified BiodynamicÂ® and Stellar Certified Organic estate that lies at the northern end of the Willamette Valley appellation and along the east-facing slope of the Coastal Range foothills in Oregon. In addition to the certifications, we use dry farming and sustainable growing practices. This is an ideal site for the nine grape varieties we grow here: Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, GewÃ¼rztraminer, Riesling, MÃ¼ller-Thurgau, Teroldeg, Lagrein, Muscat and Sauvignon Blanc.
The approach to winemaking focuses on producing wines that are an expression of the Willamette Valley, while ensuring they are approachable, food friendly and structured for graceful aging. From harvest dates to fermentation temperatures, from cultivating indigenous yeasts to selecting the perfect barrels for aging, each decision is thoughtfully made with one end goal in mind: To craft wines that reflect the place where the grapes are grown, offering freshness, liveliness and complexity, while showcasing the best characteristics of each variety.

After years searching for the perfect property, she purchased this 102-acre parcel on Alisos Canyon Road in 2006, and named it Martian Ranch â the combined nickname of her two adult sons: Martin and Ian.
Today, Martian Ranch & Vineyard is a Demeter Certified, biodynamically farmed Estate winery, with 20 acres of vines planted to 10 different grape varieties, each perfectly suited to the climate of the ranch.  The vineyards were planted in 2008 under the guidance of biodynamic consultant Philippe Armenier, with the first Estate vintage in 2011.  Martian Ranch is known for carefully farmed, vibrant and lower-alcohol wines, with Eric Bolton now at the helm as winemaker. Estate varieties are AlbariÃ±o, Grenache Blanc, Viognier, Clairette, Gamay Noir, MourvÃ¨dre, Grenache Noir, Syrah, Cabernet Franc, and Tempranillo - about 2 acres planted of each.
Biodynamic principles, which take organic farming to the next level, strive to create a diversified and balanced ecosystem while focusing on the health and fertility of the soil.  Lunar, solar, and cosmic rhythms are followed for all farming practices, which create an optimum environment for the vines. Each part of the growing process revolves around four elements: root, leaf, flower and fruit. Together, these elements create the highest expression of harvest. While these farming methods may be more labor intensive, the quality shows in each bottle, carefully crafted between the earth and the cosmos.
The tasting room opened in October 2014 and offers a wide selection of estate wines.  Each wine is named after a celestial notion, from the Stellar Viognier to Local Group Grenache Noir and Mothership Grenache Blanc.
Featured in the New York Times, SF Chronicle and Jon BonnÃ©âs book, âThe New California Wine.â   Experimental and eclectic, Martian Ranch & Vineyard is dedicated to the journey, âfrom sky to ground to grape to barrel to bottle and straight into your glass.â
Located on Alisos Canyon Road between US 101 and Foxen Canyon Road. Visit the tasting room Wednesday through Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Bocce courts, horse shoe pits and dog friendly picnic areas. UFOs welcome!

Hood Organic Farm,541-352-7492,,"Specialty varieties of apples and pears grown at the foot of Mt Hood in Oregon's Hood River Valley. Irrigated with glacial water and picked at the peak of ripeness, our 7 varieties of pears and 43 varieties of apples are known for their superior flavor. We pack and ship our own fruit, which is sold directly at our farm in the fall, at farmers markets, to CSA's and to wholesalers who distribute our fruit across the country. We will soon be shipping packed gift boxes as well.
Although the farm dates to the turn of the century (the main farmhouse was built in 1904), John and Brady Jacobson began working the orchards in 1981. Inspired by European techniques and committed to sustainable land use, the Jacobsons undertook an extensi\ve orchard renovation and transition to organic farming that resulted in full organic certification in 1989 - the first farm in the valley to achieve this status. Numerous publications from The Oregonian to the Good Fruit Grower have written articles about the farm, and the BBC and PBS have also interviewed and filmed here.
As better reflects their view of the importance of the integration of the natural landscape and wildlife into their farming practices, and returning to the deeper origins of the organic movement, Brady and John have now become BiodynamicÂ® growers. They also take pride in selling directly to loyal customers of the farm, as well as to regional markets, and donate a portion of their produce to School AidÂ®, a program in partnership with local markets and the Oregon Food Bank.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms is a unique, secluded, spectacular natural setting for hosting your one or two day weekend wedding retreat. Let your friends and families enjoy the most gorgeous mountain views (Mt Hood, Mt Adams & Mt Rainier) and gardens in the area and relax on our park-like grounds with orchards, fields, ponds, woods, and a lake. Lodging is available for up to six people in our Guest Cottage and Carriage House and maximum number of guests is 200.
The farm creates the feeling that for a day or two time has been stopped and rolled back to a different era. Unique and historic architecture in a magnificent setting coupled with fresh, organic, seasonal, farm-to-table dinners, prepared by our amazing chef make for a most memorable event. Dinners are served in our Apple House, a unique indoor/outdoor space with amazing views of Mt Hood, or on the lawn. Our staff is superb and the sense is one of family and connection.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms has been chosen twice as the Best Northwest Destination Wedding Site by Oregon Bride, and was designated this summer by MSN and The Knot as one of the most amazing wedding venues in the world.

He has written many publications, books and hundreds of speeches in support of soil building and other farming practices that the organic and BiodynamicÂ® farms embrace.
OUR MILLER
Our miller is Gary Thelen of Freeport, Minnesota. Gary is a third generation miller who took over the 100+ year old historic flour mill from his father, Walter. The mill has been in his family since 1903 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a young man, Gary worked on the family farm and was married to Sharon in 1982. In 1985 he began to focus more on the milling operation and in 1998 he completely took over the mill. Since then Gary has been carrying on and growing the family business. On December 27, 2011, two days after Christmas, Garyâs entire historic mill burned to the ground. With much encouragement from family, friends and business associates Gary rebuilt a new mill on the same site and struggled to rebuild his business.
HOW THE PUZZLE FITS TOGETHER
In the Fall of 2011 Lynda had an idea . . . what a great gift it would be to bring a Biodynamic Whole Wheat Flour into the world. And, as she shared this dream with her daughter, Jessica, the question arose, âWhatâs holding you back?â This simple question was the beginning of our journey to ISIS Biodynamic.
Lynda began to seek out a stone-grinding flour mill and luckily, through a friend in the industry, was able to locate one. We needed a place to put it and thought of Gary back in Freeport trying to recover from the fire. We asked Gary if he would house the mill and make our flour. He agreed and the mill was installed, inspected and certified by the Demeter Association.
Meanwhile Lynda and Jess had been making periodic visits to the Stone Barns Center for Agriculture in New York to see Fred Kirschenmann. We mentioned to Fred that we had purchased a mill and wanted to make BiodynamicÂ® Whole Wheat Flour from his Wheat. Fred loved the idea and agreed to grow the Wheat for us.
The rest is history, or should we say, the future! We are also delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Whole Foods Market team, and appreciate their dedication and support of providing BiodynamicÂ® products nationwide.

The Sacramento Valley was the perfect setting for Albert and Frances Lundberg to pass on their legacy of respect for the land to their four sons. Albert had seen the ravages of the Dustbowl that resulted from poor soil management and shortsighted farming techniques. After moving the family to Northern California, he impressed upon his sons the need to care for the soil. Albert went on to pioneer organic rice growing in America.
In the 1960's, Albertâs sons, Eldon, Wendell, Harlan and Homer Lundberg saw the need to sell their rice grown in such a different fashion directly to the public, rather than mixing it with rice grown by conventional methods. This gave consumers a choice in the rice they purchased, and began the Lundberg Family FarmsÂ® brand, which has become synonymous with quality, great tasting rice products grown Always in Balance with Natureâ¢.
For over 70 years Lundberg Family FarmsÂ® has been using methods of farming that care for the soil, wildlife, air and water. This special concern for the environment is equaled only by concern for product quality. What began as a small family rice farm using farming techniques ahead of its time, has grown into a mission-driven company which holds itself to a high standard in business, environmental stewardship, and the relationships it has with employees.
Today, the third generation carries on the family heritage as Lundberg Family FarmsÂ® continues to use eco-positive farming methods that produce wholesome, healthful rice products, while protecting and improving the environment for future generations.",CA,,,

We are 8 miles from Lake Michigan, and are on the direct route (M-72 West) to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Our address is: 3502 E. Traverse Hwy. Traverse City, Michigan. Please visit our âHours of Operationâ page for retail store and farm visiting hours.
Our story
Light of Day Organics was founded by a Traverse City Mom named Angela Macke in 2003. Her background in Holistic health, (as both a Registered Nurse, Educator, and Horticulturalist), plus her own positive experience utilizing gentle, natural rhythms to successfully manage an auto-immune disease, plays an integral role in the thoughtful creation of each original product. Around here, we believe that a holistic approach is the most effective way to restore optimal health and a sense of well being. Helping our customers to create healthy lifestyle habits that support the prevention of illness, increase overall vitality, passion for life, and supporting the path to full actualization of  our full potential as human beings is our daily practice and intentional goal of our work.
Our Farm and production
Our products are Certified Organic and the Lionâs share (57%)  are grown right here on our certified Demeter Biodynamic farm in Traverse City under the guidelines of the National Organic Program, and Demeter U.S. The exceptionally high quality botanicals are hand-harvested, dried in our licensed commercial farm kitchen, then finish blended in small batches by hand to promote consistency, to maximize freshness and with the intention of offering them to you in their most pristine state. We hope that you enjoy the maximal nutritive benefits as Mother Nature intended.
Certifications and Process
We believe in honest tea and honest advertising here. This means supporting local and foreign farmers through certified (third-party verified, which includes annual audits) Fair Trade certified practices (Transfair USA) , growing and buying only 100% certified Organic (Stellar certification services and Demeter Biodynamic)  agricultural commodities.  Our teas and tisanes are Gluten-free.
Conscientious Packaging
We believe in presenting these products in their most natural, loose form. They have been packaged in lovely, domestically-manufactured, polished silver tins to protect them from the elements. We used a local designer, and local printer for soy-based ink labels and other packaging needs using Earth-friendly sustainable materials. We hand blend to completion in small batches, then package and label our teas right here in our farm kitchen.
Quality of Product / Quality of Life
We wanted to make sure that taste wasnât the only thing to feel good about. Ensuring the highest quality of tea for you and life for those who bring it to us is part of our mission. We honor all of those involved in bringing this extremely labor-intensive crop from the fields to our cup by paying everyone a proper living wage and encouraging the spiritual sacredness of the family unit and community with time off from work to recharge and to play in this beautiful area that we are blessed to call âhomeâ.
It is Light of Dayâs sincere intention that you may enjoy balance and reach your full potential as a human being! We want for everyone to enjoy superb health, inner peace, joyfulness, and be on a well-lit path that will benefit the greater good with all that you do. We hope that you will discover, (and hopefully learn to cherish), the ancient and life-giving ritual of having a âspot of tea.â
For all of us here at Light of Day, tea is so more than an iced beverage to soothe your thirst in the Summertime, or to comfort your sore throat in the Wintertime.  We have come to appreciate that the commitment to daily self care  by taking time out to enjoy tea is a representative of the commitment and conscious choice  to live simply, and to live each day with a wonder and deep reverence for every created thing.
We really appreciate you taking the time to learn about us, and hope that you'll visit our Press Page to watch a PBS special where we were featured, ad well as read other good press.

Tradition. Stewardship.
Those pillars have proved a solid and true foundation for the winery that today produces some of Oregonâs most recognizable and best-loved wines.
Co-founders Ed King III and his father, the late Ed King, Jr., had a vision for a 600-acre parcel of land they discovered in the southern Willamette Valley that was used to grow hay and pasture cattle. Over the years that parcel has evolved into one of Oregonâs most recognizable and iconic vineyards with 1,033 acres of certified BiodynamicÂ® land. Three generations of the King family are involved in the family business, continuing the old-world traditions of sustainable agriculture and artisan winemaking.
Meticulous fruit selection, impeccable practices and thoughtful blending are hallmarks of winemaking at King Estate. Part of Oregonâs renowned Willamette Valley region, King Estate is best known for its superb Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir. The pure taste of Oregon may be found in every bottle.

We have a milking herd of 45 cows, the majority of which are Brown Swiss and Friesian. We also have 40 to 50 young dairy calves, heifers, and bulls. We are committed to rotational grazing as a management tool for the health and sustainability of the animals and the land. Our animals are fed solely on diverse pastures from April to November. In winter, they are housed in loafing sheds and fed grass-based silage.

The vineyard is part of the Eola-Amity AVA (American Viticultural Area), a wine region blessed with the cooling afternoon Van Duzer Winds from the ocean during the warm ripening season. This helps retain good acidity and balance in the fruit we grow in the volcanic, shallow soils of the area.
Our story begins in 1989 when Craig and Gabriele Keeler were searching for properties to begin a new chapter in their lives and decided to take a walk through a picturesque hillside in Amity, Oregon. When Gabriele saw, on this long time abandoned, overgrown with blackberries, piece of land, the view to the south with views of Mary's Peak and Oregon's coastal mountains she grabbed Craig's hand and said ""CK, this is the place!"".  In 1990 the Keeler family moved to their 200 acre property and through many years of hard work they transformed what was once fields of blackberry's, rocky terrain and dilapidated structures to what is today; a home and Keeler Estate Vineyard.  It's a truly magical place consisting of a thriving biodynamic vineyard, gardens, forest, lakes, streams, acres of landscaping and plenty room for entertaining.

We both grew up on small farms in the Midwest and never expected to fall in love with a piece of land again, but we did!  Our ranch is rugged and suited to vineyards, aromatic plants, trees, and goats (our compost makers).
We began using Biodynamic techniques in our farming in 1999 because our vines were weak and our grapes, not ripening.  Not only did our grapes ripen, but we increased production by 90%. The health of our soil has improved so much we barely irrigate the vines.
We grow chardonnay grapes as well as lavender, rosemary, rose geranium, helichrysum italicum and are excitedly awaiting our first bumper crop of fuyu persimmons. Most of our lavender is Grosso, a lavendin, a hybrid of spike lavender and English lavender. It has about 16 times the amount of oil as true English lavender, which makes it ideal for dried flowers. We are experimenting with an English lavender developed in Oregon, Buena Vista, to see how it survives our winters. We dry some of the lavender and Donald estate distills the aromatics. We sell the hydrosols to small cosmetic makers as well as wholesale to local stores and we have a store on the internet. Once a year when the lavender is in full bloom we have an Open House, which we announce on our website. (2014 we are taking a break due to replanting of significant amounts of lavender.)

Our 120 acre farm along the banks of the Great Miami River near Tipp City, Ohio, offers clients a place to experience various activities centered within the calming and healing powers of the land.

In 2006 after decades of traditional farming practices we recognized the need to repair and heal the soil for future generations. We embarked on a transition to organic farming practices and in 2009 we received USDA/NOP organic certification and in 2012 our BiodynamicÂ® certification. More than 500 lavender plants make up our foundation crop. In addition, we raise over 14 other herbs and each year we add to that diversity. The hay in the upper fields provides food for organic dairy cattle that pasture with us from a neighboring farm.
Increasing the âlife forceâ of the soil through the BiodynamicÂ® practices allows us to grow plants that are full of vitality which are harvested and processed by hand to make the highest quality infusions, tinctures and essences. Our certified organic and BiodynamicÂ® cosmetic products and herbal supplements are the result of this âcircle of lifeâ that is part of Harmony Farm.
Our product line includes over 30 certified BiodynamicÂ® flower essences made from both cultivated and wild-crafted plants growing on the farm. These flower essences are the result of an energetic imprint of the flower on water, impacting our emotional issues and blockages on an energetic or vibrational level.
Our lip balms and infused body oils are hand-crafted in small batches from the vibrant flowers in our gardens. Tinctures such as osha root are made by extracting the plant material using BiodynamicÂ® alcohol. Our Garlic Mullein ear drops, one of our infused medicinal oils, helps soothe achy ears.

Finca Luna Nueva is a living classroom where people can come to study and learn. This is the essence of what makes this place so very special: diversity. Biodiversity of the rainforest and the bright assortment of individuals that find their way to us.
The tapestry of Finca Luna Nueva has been woven with nothing less than miraculous individuals, both local and foreign, integrating to create a place to teach and inspire.  The farm is alive with energy and excitement from the biodynamic method we employ and by the sacred bond we have with the land and the preservation of our most precious natural resource: the rain forest.
We honor the farmers of Finca Luna Nueva who, largely unseen by the world, are contributing to the seed-saving and organic movement and supporting rainforest preservation.

The farm is now the exclusive kitchen garden for world-renowned Manresa Restaurant (Los Gatos, California).
Cynthia Sandberg, owner and farmer, uses biodynamic and organic techniques to grow over 300 different cultivars of fruit, vegetables, herbs and edible flowers for the restaurant.  Beginning her work life as a trial attorney, Cynthia transitioned to farming after falling in love with gardening in her backyard on a bit more than one acre in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  Founding Love Apple in 2000, Cynthia started as a tomato plant grower and had a small tomato fruit stand on her Ben Lomond property.  In 2010, she purchased 22 acres on the former site of the Smothers Brothers Winery on Vine Hill Road in Santa Cruz and re-established her farm on the terraced hillside.
Achieving Demeter certification as a biodynamic farm in 2012 was a proud milestone for Love Apple.  Cynthia has spoken at numerous gardening and farming conferences and garden clubs, including the San Francisco Flower & Garden Show, Eco-Farm, MAD Symposium in Copenhagen and Nordic Barista Cup in Oslo, Norway.  Cynthia is a sought-after garden speaker on topics such as Mastering the Art of the Tomato, Introduction to Biodynamic Gardening, Farmer/Chef Relationships, and How to Make a Living from your Backyard Garden.  Cynthia can be contacted by emailing her at loveapplefarms@gmail.com
We give a number of fun and informative gardening and cooking classes at the farm during the year.  Topics covered have included âTomato Seed Starting Class,""  ""Cheese-Making,"" Chicken-Keeping,""  ""Summer Vegetable Gardening,"" ""Container Vegetable Gardening,"" ""Bee-Keeping,"" Winter Vegetable Gardening,"" ""Simple Drip Irrigation System,"" and our popular ""Tomato Masters"" class for real tomato aficionados.
Love Apple Farms also offers off-site satellite workshops for organizations.  If you are interested in bringing the farm to your business or club for an on-site workshop, please contact us at loveapplefarms@gmail.com.
Love Apple Farms is home to the largest tomato plant sale in California, with well over 100 varieties of heirloom tomato seedlings each spring, from March to June.  Our retail greenhouse is at Ivy's Porch, located at 5311 Scotts Valley Drive, Scotts Valley, CA.

We are mindful of where and how our ingredients are produced, closely monitor production methods, and recognize the impact of our business practices on the people we encounter, the lifestyles we influence, and the preservation of our planet. Omica Organics does not purchase products or ingredients on the common market, but works closely with growers and processors in the US and around the world to offer the best products in ways that promote health, sustainability, and eco-awareness. We are passionate about paying fair wages and prices, maintaining honesty and responsibility, and promoting respect and goodwill in our endeavors.
Omica Organics is directly associated with Sophiaâs Gardens in Sebastopol, California, a biodynamically-run farm that grows for our company, and who researches and archives information on biodynamic farming techniques. Sophiaâs Gardens is a single-family owned farm where crops are picked by hand and processed manually using age-old techniques that preserve the goodness of the plant. Our founderâs involvement with Anthroposophic research, biodynamic farming and water-flow technology (based on Rudolph Steiner and Viktor Schaubergerâs works) spans 38+ years.
We contract with local farmers and ensure that they follow organic methodologies. We promote and buy organic only, inspiring farmers to follow organic practices, and encouraging manufacturers to promote organic farmers and farming techniques through economic need and markets. This not only supports farmers in the US, but helps to support an organic standard of industry in India and China. We purchase only from these organic farmers, then process without using synthetic solvents. We have partners on-site in these countries to verify adherence to strict organic standards.
Our proprietary stevia is cultivated from an extensive network of family-owned stevia farms. Self-sustaining farming methods help preserve the naturally-beneficial phytochemicals of the stevia leaf. The stevia leaves are picked by hand at the peak of the growing season, then dried naturally using sunlight and fresh air. The support we provide helps to keep these historically significant farming practices from disappearing completely.
We use no fillers or artificial ingredients and all capsules are non-gelatin vegetarian. No synthetic preservatives are found in our products. We use organic vegetable glycerin (made fresh specifically for our use; and not sourced from industrial byproducts) along with organic biodynamic grape alcohol to preserve our products when necessary.
We endeavor to uphold eco-friendly office and shipping practices. For instance, the popcorn used in our shipping packaging is a biodegradable cornstarch product that breaks down completely within 2 months. Our paperless practices preserve trees, we print on the backs of used paper whenever feasible, and we recycle everything possible including shredded documents, food and drink containers, and toner/ink cartridges.

Owners John Schaeffer and Nantzy Hensley have lived on and worked the farm since 2001. Our Biodynamic farm and homestead is a microcosm of the image of life.
Surrounding our farm is the wild and untouched forest; as the fertility, pest control, and water dynamics that a healthy forest needs to thrive lie within the forestâs ecosystem itself.  Abundant with life, our farm breathes in the untamed forest that surrounds us and breathes out a unique vitality through our lavender, fruit and nut orchards, grapes  olives, and vegetable gardens
SunHawk Farms is rooted in holistic observations of life itself.  When we look at nature holistically, it becomes evident that numerous forces are at work, molding matter into an infinite myriad of delicate and pristine forms, colors, and aromas that defy the laws of gravity.  If you observe closely  the growing tips and resulting morphology of most green plants, you will see an expression of grasping at sunlight, spiraling, enveloping â a pulling of a plant species into form.
SunHawk Farms is a dynamic system complete with bio-diverse habitat and internal humus-based fertility.  Near the chicken coop you will find compost consisting of matter created at SunHawk.  Then, behind the olive orchard -consisting of around 2,800 Tuscan varieties of olive trees- and above the vast oak and madrone forest, youâll be treated to red-tailed hawks, snowy egrets, great blue herons, and soaring bald eagles.
Along the rolling hills behind Hopland, in verdant and wild Mendocino County, our grapes grow on the south facing slopes of a bow.  On it we raise several varieties of Rhone grapes - which are combined into a field blend much like the old Italians  and French have done for generations.
The critical point for biodynamic agriculture at SunHawk Farms is that even the tiniest aspect of our farming system, a seed or a bud for instance, contains the archetypal imprint of life.  The result is good agronomy practices developed by 1970âs Mendocino Homesteaders and organic gardeners, John Schaeffer and Nancy Hensley.",CA,True,www.sunhawkfarms.org,

We use no fillers or artificial ingredients and all capsules are non-gelatin vegetarian. No synthetic preservatives are found in our products. We use organic vegetable glycerin (made fresh specifically for our use; and not sourced from industrial byproducts) along with organic biodynamic grape alcohol to preserve our products when necessary.
We endeavor to uphold eco-friendly office and shipping practices. For instance, the popcorn used in our shipping packaging is a biodegradable cornstarch product that breaks down completely within 2 months.

We strive to preserve the nutritive value and vitality of every ingredient in our organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, low glycemic, kosher, raw, vegan/vegetarian, healthy and natural products. Many of our methodologies and formulations are entirely exclusive to the company.
We are mindful of where and how our ingredients are produced, closely monitor production methods, and recognize the impact of our business practices on the people we encounter, the lifestyles we influence, and the preservation of our planet. Omica Organics does not purchase products or ingredients on the common market, but works closely with growers and processors in the US and around the world to offer the best products in ways that promote health, sustainability, and eco-awareness. We are passionate about paying fair wages and prices, maintaining honesty and responsibility, and promoting respect and goodwill in our endeavors.
Omica Organics is directly associated with Sophiaâs Gardens in Sebastopol, California, a biodynamically-run farm that grows for our company, and who researches and archives information on biodynamic farming techniques. Sophiaâs Gardens is a single-family owned farm where crops are picked by hand and processed manually using age-old techniques that preserve the goodness of the plant. Our founderâs involvement with Anthroposophic research, biodynamic farming and water-flow technology (based on Rudolph Steiner and Viktor Schaubergerâs works) spans 38+ years.
We contract with local farmers and ensure that they follow organic methodologies. We promote and buy organic only, inspiring farmers to follow organic practices, and encouraging manufacturers to promote organic farmers and farming techniques through economic need and markets. This not only supports farmers in the US, but helps to support an organic standard of industry in India and China. We purchase only from these organic farmers, then process without using synthetic solvents. We have partners on-site in these countries to verify adherence to strict organic standards.
Our proprietary stevia is cultivated from an extensive network of family-owned stevia farms. Self-sustaining farming methods help preserve the naturally-beneficial phytochemicals of the stevia leaf.

A variety of grapes, including Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah are grown over 48 ha of cultivated land, however NakbÃ© is more than just a vineyard, it is a piece of art, a perfect example of the symphony between man and land.
The fusion of nature and art is immediately apparent at Finca NakbÃ©. The enormous labyrinth, grown from only Malbec grapevines, encompasses a philosophy integral to the vineyard; the creation of great wine in equilibrium with a care and passion for the land on which it is grown. The land that gives the vines life, after all, gives life to man also.
Furthermore, a glass of wine is brought to life by the land and this is achieved so effectively here through the practice of biodynamics. The vineyard has been Demeter certified biodynamic since 2012, taking practices beyond organic through the generation of NakbÃ©âs inputs, such as native yeast,  from the living dynamics of the vineyard. At Ernesto Catena Vineyards, wine is made through the translation of land to glass. Here, the winemaker does not create, he interprets and in the words of Alejandro, winemaker at Ernesto Catena Vineyards, âthis is the most genuine way of representing our terroir and making the best wines.â
Man and land exist in total harmony at the vineyard and the balance of viticulture and nature resounds throughout, not only in the atmosphere of the place but woven into the land and, in turn, through the vines, the grapes and of course the wine.
It is not only the land that affects the farm, universal energy is a pillar of biodynamics, the energy omnipresent in the cosmos has a significant influence on life and therefore the vineyard. A calendar taking into account the movement of the sun, moon and stars is used to ensure the perfect moment to undertake specific tasks.
To stand in Finca NakbÃ© is to be transported to the very roots of wine making. It is not âworkedâ but rather, it is cultivated and supported like a living organism. The chickens and the llamas, the cows and the vegetables are each instrumental to the life of the vineyard, together they form the extraordinary dynamic that is our finca. This holistic approach emphasizes the spirit so intrinsic to the wines from here, a real sense of all things working as one, everything intertwined.
Tasting a wine from Ernesto Catena is not just about taste, it evokes a sense of place, of the land, the soil and it is easy to see why.",,True,,True

Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and finally to Californiaâs Silicon Valley. After starting his own companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines held more interest for Barbara every day.
Biodiversity
Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard areas, providing weed control for us â and entertainment for the neighbors.
A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.
Energy Conservation
Puma Springsâ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system provides all hot water for the office.
Terroir
Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.
Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. Biodynamics is not only good for the earth and good for the environment; it helps produce exceptional wine grapes.

The vineyards lie within the Paso Robles American Viticultural Area and are Demeter Certified Biodynamic and Stellar Certified Organic.  Planting began in 1995 for approximately 40 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon and 20 acres of Syrah.  The grapes are sold to some of the most discerning winemakers, who recognize the important synergy in whole eco-system of nature to capture and preserve the character and purity of the fruit providing the wine with an âauthenticâ sense of place.
A wild life corridor of oak trees, giant old snags, and indigenous grasses bisects the vineyards and pastures so that wild deer and foxes can travel through or spend some time in a natural habitat where Great-horned Owls, Red-tailed Hawks and a brilliant American Kestrel make their home. Foremost in thought is the âwhole farmâ approach:  from the microbial content of the soil, nutrition, vines, song birds, bees, lady bugs and lacewings, wild flowers and sheep to the friendliest kitty cats you will ever meet.

Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and finally to Californiaâs Silicon Valley. After starting his own companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines held more interest for Barbara every day.
Biodiversity
Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard areas, providing weed control for us â and entertainment for the neighbors.
A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.
Energy Conservation
Puma Springsâ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system provides all hot water for the office.
Terroir
Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.
Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. Biodynamics is not only good for the earth and good for the environment; it helps produce exceptional wine grapes.

Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and finally to Californiaâs Silicon Valley. After starting his own companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines held more interest for Barbara every day.
Biodiversity
Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard areas, providing weed control for us â and entertainment for the neighbors.
A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.
Energy Conservation
Puma Springsâ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system provides all hot water for the office.
Terroir
Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.
Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. Biodynamics is not only good for the earth and good for the environment; it helps produce exceptional wine grapes.

The 5-acre vineyard is home to a field blend of 18 different rootstocks and clones of Pinot Noir, designed to all be fermented together to increase complexity and depth of flavor. The vineyard itself sits on a 10-acre farm that also grows olives, apples, walnuts, plums, cherries and various other berries and fruits. The vineyard has been farmed to Biodynamic tenets since 2000 and was Demeter and Organic (Stellar) certified in 2005. We create our own compost for this vineyard as well as all of the Biodynamic preparations. There are three distinct sites within this small vineyard with varying amounts of topsoil and fractured Basalt. Each block is planted with a rootstock that will help the vine prosper in their unique situation.

not a person, but the rare and magical property that for years local vintners coveted for its
potential to grow great Pinot Noir. In 1999, this land in the heart of Santa Barbaraâs Santa
Rita Hills AVA became Sea Smoke Vineyard. Located on south-facing hillside bluffs, our
Sea Smoke Estate receives plenty of sunshine â but then, so does most of California. What
makes our vineyard truly special is its shallow clay soils, south facing slopes, and the layer
of marine fog (sea âsmokeâ) that travels up the Santa Ynez River canyon each evening,
cooling our vines. This cooling influence makes extended âhangtimeâ possible prior to
harvest â allowing flavors and tannins to fully mature, while still maintaining lovely acidity.
This results in wines that are lush, elegant and expressive.
Because we are an estate winery and the California equivalent of a âMonopoleâ, we do not
buy or sell grapes. Our obsession with Pinot Noir has its roots â literally and figuratively â
in our estate vineyard, and our obsession is apparent in the way we farm. We strive for low
crop yields and small grape clusters, so our vineyard is planted with ten top-quality Pinot
Noir clones on vigor-reducing rootstocks. Every one of our vines receives individual care
and handling from our vineyard crew at least eight times a year â every single vine. Since
our estate vineyard will hopefully outlast us all, we decided to be good stewards of the land:
we have been farming sustainably since 2003, began farming biodynamically in 2005, and in 2016 our estate vineyard received biodynamic certification from Demeter.
Because lab tests never tell the whole story, we ultimately rely on our taste buds to make most decisions, including the time to harvest.  The east and west sides of each block are
usually picked at different times, for example, and after hand harvesting, grapes are chilled
overnight, pre-sorted, de-stemmed and then carefully table sorted. Meanwhile, we evaluate
the clonal characteristics and tannin profile of each and every harvested block, tailoring
our corresponding fermentations accordingly. We keep each block and clone combination
separate throughout fermentation and aging. This helps us develop a deep understanding
of the characteristics of each vineyard block, observing how each responds to specific barrel
profiles in our cellar, and ultimately gives us an array of flavors and characteristics to draw
upon during blending.
Since our wines are made in limited quantities and can be difficult to find, Sea Smoke
allocates to members through our List. The List is fair and uncomplicated. Joining The List
guarantees an allocation once activated. Unlike wine clubs, we require no minimum
purchase commitment or cost to join. For more information about our new releases, or to

He has studied biodynamic agriculture in the US, Switzerland, and Germany, and collaborates with other experts in the field in the formulation of all our products, with the goal of providing high-potency, herbal-based products that help achieve and maintain wellbeing.

We promote a truly biodiverse oasis and value and respect nature, its ecosystems and all organisms, adhering to the principles of Common Good.
A cornerstone of our project is Sanandi's Valle la Paz Foundation, funded in part with proceeds from sales of our herbal products. It focuses on the following 3 key areas: 1) Working with school-age children in the surrounding impoverished communities, providing free, nutritious hot meals to more than 350 children every day, and supporting their education by sponsoring music, art, and health integrative courses; 2) Operating a rural health clinic that provides a holistic approach to wellbeing; and 3) Promoting biological and organic agriculture with local farmers so that they may cultivate with respect for the land and the environment, and receive a fair and dignified remuneration for their harvest.",DE,,sanandi.com,

He saw the advantage of Biodynamic grown seed, and the need to bring Biodynamic farming practices and techniques to the US. The Biodynamic farms produced bountiful crops, and the seeds harvested from these crops had exceptional vigor. These farms were able to produce crops and seeds in a way that was much more âwhole farmâ sustainable than current organic practices. In fact, they were light years beyond. Tom often refers to Biodynamic as âbeyond organic.â
Upon returning to the US, Tom began the process of certifying Territorial Seedâs organic farm as Biodynamic. Through a process that took over two years, the entire farm has achieved Stellar Organic certification and the coveted International Demeter Biodynamic Certification.
Territorial Seed Company is bringing Biodynamic vegetable seed to the home gardener through their new Sero Biodynamic Seed product line.

An original RhÃ´ne Ranger, veteran winemaker Bob Lindquist was one of the first to advocate American-made Syrah and other RhÃ´ne varietals such as Grenache, Roussanne, and Marsanne. He has been a leader in the movement producing world class editions since the early 1980s. The winery is located in California's northern Santa Barbara County.
Bob has mentored dozens of winemakers over the years including his wife, Louisa Sawyer Lindquist. With Louisa as winemaker, Bob partnered in a second winery, Verdad (the Spanish word for ""truth""), which specializes in Spanish varieties.  To take their wines to the next level, Bob and Louisa purchased an 80-acre ranch in the Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo County in 2002. The couple installed the 40-acre Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard, which is planted to Pinot Noir, Marsanne, Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, and AlbariÃ±o, and is certifiably farmed according to strict Demeter Biodynamic standards. Resulting wines consistently hit the 90 point plus wine review scale.

The estate vineyard, Winderlea, is a legendary 20 acre parcel originally planted in the 70s on the Red Hills Bench in Dundee.  First known as the Dundee Hills Vineyard, today it is Winderlea, a name derived from combining the words ""wind"" and ""lea"" meaning field or meadow.
Spouses Donna Morris and Bill Sweat purchased the property in 2006 upon their move to Oregon.  Like the founders they followed to Oregon, Bill and Donna are committed to continuing the traditions of responsible stewardship of the land and the highest quality artisan winemaking.  In addition to earning Demeter BiodynamicÂ® Certification in 2015, Winderlea became just the 4th winery globally to achieve B Corp Certification - a whole business sustainability certification.

-Meghan Rowe, Co-Founder & CEO, White Leaf Provisions
My husband Keith and I founded White Leaf Provisions in February of 2016, following the birth of our son, Keegan. Both as concerned parents and conscious consumers looking for the purest options for our family, we quickly became aware of a lack of truly pure and organic foods that were simple in their design and taste and farmed in an eco-minded way.
With the increasing amount of unanswered questions regarding our current food products and farming methods, we began speaking with more parents and realized that we werenât the only ones looking for healthier, more sustainable options. Products that care as much about the way in which they are farmed as the taste and purity of the final product.
Keith, a native of Ireland, is a classically French-trained chef. He grew up in a small village in Ireland where locally farmed and sourced food was the basis for every meal. This mindset has shaped Keithâs career and passion for pure foods â foods that are minimally processed, with flavor being directed by seasons, not additives.
We believe many of those same values are reflected in the biodynamic concept.
I come from a family of serial entrepreneurs being very successful in many fields from health foods to commerce. Growing up around those ideals helped shape my desire for developing and sharing healthier food options and mindful living. Becoming a mother and realizing that you play a big part in shaping your child's eating habits has certainly reinforced those ideas.
White Leaf is certified by Demeter USA, the International seal of approval for Biodynamic farming practices and products. We proudly use proceeds from these products to sponsor the next generation of sustainable farmers and farm-to-school gardening and educational programs in North America.
Weâre excited to share our own experiences and what weâve learned to make mindful living less overwhelming and more attainable for you.
Thank you for visiting!

Sustainable agriculture had been the intersections of our passions and careers importing and distributing organic foods, however we'd never been farmers.
Our rural home was on 20 acres of land originally part of a larger farm established in the 1830s and abandoned following WWII. We have added neighboring acreage that was part of the original farm and today our family farm totals 80 acres located in New York State in Allegany county. We have an abundance of long forgotten old growth apple trees where we have cleared brush and thorns (multi floral rose, grrrrr!) to give them light and space. We've planted a small orchard with more apples, as well as peaches, cherries, apricots, and pears. We're in the process of establishing a vineyard. Recently we began to wild forage ramps and deliver to farm to fork restaurants in Manhattan and Brooklyn and leading retailers like Wegmans. This year we started to inoculate bolts of beech logs with mycelium to grow mushrooms. We have chickens and ducks and turkeys. We have raised pigs. We're learning more about cows and see their addition to the farm in the near future.
All parents worry about what they feed their kids. We felt a powerful impulse to nurture the land with and for them. We wanted to better understand what it meant to farm sustainably. We are learning as we go as a family, and increasingly our three children are leading projects around the farm. We participate in farmer trainings locally and attend Biodynamic Conferences to increase our understanding of farming to the Demeter standard. Sometimes it's difficult to separate play from work at the Yellow Barn Farm. We spend time together as a family, and we know our farmer!

Seeing parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its environment became a key element of his approach.
This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the Brooks program from the beginning. âIf the vine is happy, the grapes simply taste better.â Jimi once said, âI believe that farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of terroir.â
The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a disservice to them to use any other farming method that would intrude on what the earth provides.
Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.
Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks Wine. Winemaker friends whoâd gathered at his memorial service compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimiâs philosophy. A dozen of Oregonâs top winemakers saw the 2004 vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimiâs assistant) became Head Winemaker; Jimiâs sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of Brooksâ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter farming.
Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooksâ story figured prominently in âAmerican Wine Story,â a film about inspiration and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and weâre been able to increase the number of outside vineyards weâre able to source grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout the process.
The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look forward to your stopping by when youâre in the area.

The hazelnut orchard had been âcustom farmedâ by non-resident farmers in the age of âBetter Living Through Chemistry.â Their list of chemical inputs included all the ingredients of Rachael Carsonâs âSilent Springâ and more â¦ DDT, Paraquat, Simazineâ¦the list went on and on, to my private horror. The house was dilapidated: a rental. One tenant was living in a bus parked in the oak grove.
But in January of 1990 the whole farm went Cold Turkey.
We certified all 40 acres for organic agriculture and, with the planting of the first 10 acres of Pinot Noir, set out on a journey into what was at the time largely Terra Incognita in the north Willamette Valley. We committed to stopping all applications of synthetically compounded chemicals on our land. We observed our vines struggling to overcome the residues in the soil. They competed with the abundant grasses and weeds that thrive in moist Willamette Valley soil. We had to find and/or devise alternatives. Needless to say, the early seasons passed on a trial and error basis. We farmed, as Indiana Jones might have said, âmaking it up as we went along.â
But farm we did, and with measured success. We learned over time the best ways to keep the weeds and mildew at bay. There was no shortage of demand for our certified organic fruit. And by 1993 it was exhilarating to taste the wines made from it. Organic farming liberated our land from dependence on chemical agriculture. By 2002, we were seeking ways to enrich and stimulate our soils and our plants to even better all-around health and vitality.
In time, BiodynamicsÂ® emerged as a possible way to achieve that goal.  A lot of Biodynamic practitioners advise growers to âfollow the forest !â
I think Biodynamic agriculture holds particular appeal for winegrowers. It calls for close attention to natureâs cycles and harnesses energies not always obvious to the naked eye. More than most, Biodynamic winegrowers rely on natureâs ability to transform materials; on metamorphosis and the cycles of decay, death and life.
Take our compost, for instance : Grape pomace â solids, seeds and stems left from making our wines â is combined with straw, hay, leaf refuse, garden cuttings and other carbonaceous material and mixed with organic cow manure to form large, static piles of compost. There the remnants of the first fermentation (that turned grape juice into wine) undergo a form of second ferment; with the help of worms instead of yeast, bacteria and other micro-organisms, these mounds of refuse come alive, generating temperatures in excess of 160 degrees F. They include the BiodynamicÂ® preparations of camomile, oak bark, valerian, dandelion flowers, yarrow and stinging nettle. The result over time is rich, dark compost laden with nutrients and microbes that deliver vitality to our plants for yet another seasonâ¦and another vintage.
We brew compost teas. Some are sprayed on the vineyard soil to stimulate its all important microbial life. Some teas are applied directly to the plants to enliven photosynthesis and enliven the plantâs natural resistance to disease.
While the organic practices are largely passive, the BiodynamicÂ® practices are pro-active. They feed our farm and our imagination. We have come to regard the farm as a wholistic organismâ much like the human bodyâ built on interdependent relationships that, when in good health, act and react in harmonious balance.
Much has been written about BiodynamicsÂ®. Rudolph Steiner was, in the early 20th century, certainly its most prominent proponent. But we believe the practices Steiner suggested are rooted in much older, ancient schools of thought about the natural world. At Brick House we choose to follow and to enhance our own intuitive understanding of them.",OR,True,brickhousewines.com,True

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmerâs market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldnât see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. âI have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,â she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organicâs distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. âI want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.â
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Heleneâs interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. âIt gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit â even though it may look like others â has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,â said Helene.
â People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,â Helene commented. âIt is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.â She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. âI am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purÃ©es and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com/,

Beaver Creek Vineyards is located in Lake County, a truly unique corner of California. With the largest natural freshwater lake entirely in California, appropriately called Clear Lake, this county has been revered for centuries by the native populations of California, who prize the lake and its environs for their healing properties. Mount Konocti, an inactive volcano on the south shore of Clear Lake, gave the Lake County its volcanic soil and helped to create the area's lovely hills full of unspoiled vegetation and flora and its many hot springs, which have been long prized for their healing properties.
In the preface to his famous book, ""Wine, From Heaven on Earth,"" French Biodynamic winemaker Nicholas Joly writes the following: ""Biodynamic, wakes up in some the uncritical admiration, categorical dismissal in others, and yet an absolute misunderstanding in most.""
Beaver Creek uses the Biodynamic process to bring nature back in to balance. Biodynamic is not a method.  It is a direction that is one step beyond organic which we use to create an outstanding, original wine that is an expression of harmony between vines and winemaker. Just one look in a standard vineyard and a Biodynamic vineyard and it is easy to see the difference. A vineyard farmed in the standard way has dead soil, void of any micro creatures, bugs, limited vegetation, vines fortified by artificial fertilizers, sprayed by artificial herbicides.
On the other hand, a Biodynamic vineyard is rich in micro organisms, bugs and animals grazing on a variety of different plants that enrich the soil and the vines. Personal attention with a sense of unity or 'wholeness' with our universe creates a vineyard that is able to naturally express itself. We maintain a minimal impact on the environment and our natural surroundings.
Because of this, the wines don't bear the 'prescribed' taste and flavor of many others. Our wines are original, and we strive to produce a product of the cleanest, purest quality. We don't create our wines in the laboratory. The fragrance and taste of our wine comes only from the elements of nature. We use natural yeast, no filtration and the absolute minimum of amount of sulfites, so people sensitive to sulfites are usually not affected by our wine.

After watching hours of how-to videos and turning our fraternity kitchen into a big science experiment, we eventually decided to give up our corporate job offers to instead become full-time mushroom farmers. What started as curiosity about urban farming has turned into a passion to Undo Foodâ¢ and reconnect families back to where it comes from through fun and delicious ready to grow and ready to eat products.
And that passion to Undo Food is what took us from organic mushroom kits to stoneground breakfast cereal. Sometimes, we want to grow food ourselves, taste the absolute freshness, and show kids how mushrooms or herbs grow. And at the other times, we're busy, running out the door, and we just want to eat something - like breakfast cereal - that's already been cooked for us. But we believe the underlying trust, transparency, and consciousness shouldn't change from the produce aisle to the grocery aisle, or from ready to grow to ready to eat. We believe in a future where all food comes from the kitchen, not a lab; and where R&D; teams aren't biochemists, but our grandparents.
We hope you join us & the Back to the Roots family as we work to Undo Food and connect back to where it comes from.

Amity, OR 97101, United States",Biodynamic | Vineyard | Winery | ,"Fruit,Grapes For Wine",2018-07-02,janie@brookswine.com,https://web.archive.org/web/20180702014630/http://www.biodynamicfood.org:80/biodynamic/brooks-vineyard,Brooks Winery,(503) 435-1278,"Wine,Wine Red,Wine White","Brooks Winery came to life in 1998, after founder Jimi Brooks had spent time in France, where he worked with wineries who were using biodynamic farming principles in their vineyards. Seeing parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its environment became a key element of his approach.
This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the Brooks program from the beginning. âIf the vine is happy, the grapes simply taste better.â Jimi once said, âI believe that farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of terroir.â
The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a disservice to them to use any other farming method that would intrude on what the earth provides.
Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.
Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks Wine. Winemaker friends whoâd gathered at his memorial service compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimiâs philosophy. A dozen of Oregonâs top winemakers saw the 2004 vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimiâs assistant) became Head Winemaker; Jimiâs sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of Brooksâ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter farming.
Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooksâ story figured prominently in âAmerican Wine Story,â a film about inspiration and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and weâre been able to increase the number of outside vineyards weâre able to source grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout the process.
The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look forward to your stopping by when youâre in the area.

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmerâs market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldnât see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. âI have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,â she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organicâs distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. âI want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.â
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Heleneâs interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. âIt gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit â even though it may look like others â has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,â said Helene.
â People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,â Helene commented. âIt is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.â She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. âI am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purÃ©es and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons.

Recently in 2013, the 2009 COWHORN Syrah was awarded Best of the West in Sunset Magazine, the 2009 COWHORN Reserve Syrah was named 50 Best Wines by Portland Monthly Magazine, the 2012 COWHORN Spiral 36 was listed on the 2013 Top 100 Wines by Jon BonnÃ© and the San Francisco Chronicle, and the 2012 COWHORN Marsanne Roussanne was listed in David Schildknecht's Guide to the Best of 2013 on Robert Parker's Wine Advocate website. In addition, Robert Parkerâs The Wine Advocate rated five COWHORN wines 92+ points in 2013, after rating seven earlier vintages 91+ points in 2012. In 2011, the 2009 COWHORN Viognier was added to Paul Greguttâs Top 100 Pacific Northwest Wines list.
Sharing qualities comparable to the Chateauneuf-du-Pape region of Franceâs southern Rhone Valley, COWHORN sits alongside Southern Oregonâs pristine Applegate River. The farm is fringed by frontier forests and supported by soils that are perfectly suited for various classic, Rhone grape varieties, including Syrah, Grenache, Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne. As a result, COWHORN produces balanced, Rhone-style, fine wines with low alcohol and high aroma that express the signature subtleties of the farmâs unique soils.
Guided by horticulturist Alan York and consultant winemaker Ken Bernards, COWHORN planted its first eleven acres of vineyard in 2005. Using state-of-the-art technology, winemakers Bill and Barbara Steele gently and patiently nudge native yeast through the fermentation process on a mission to make fine wine with few inputs, going from grapes to glass as purely as possible.
COWHORN benefits from being surrounded by biodiversity that serves as a natural immune system for the vineyard and gardens. When combined with organic and Biodynamic farming methods, this symbiotic relationship not only minimizes the need for petrochemical pesticides but supports the vitality of the surrounding ecosystem. Over half of the estate is reserved for habitat, forest and riparian areas. Currently, the vineyard is 25 acres and lavender and produce account for 4 acres combined.
Because Biodynamic farming is deeply rooted in the practice of perennial polyculture, crops are selected that pair well in the field and on the table. COWHORN supplies 6,000-7,000 pounds of fresh asparagus to local markets and grocery stores. Depending on volumes and season, at certain times wine club members and tasting room visitors can purchase asparagus or orchard fruit. Other areas of development include our 1,000 lavender plants.

The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the farm.
The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory â the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldnât dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farmâs rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmerâs market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldnât see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. âI have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,â she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organicâs distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. âI want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.â
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Heleneâs interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. âIt gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit â even though it may look like others â has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,â said Helene.
â People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,â Helene commented. âIt is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.â She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. âI am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purÃ©es and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

Recently in 2013, the 2009 COWHORN Syrah was awarded Best of the West in Sunset Magazine, the 2009 COWHORN Reserve Syrah was named 50 Best Wines by Portland Monthly Magazine, the 2012 COWHORN Spiral 36 was listed on the 2013 Top 100 Wines by Jon BonnÃ© and the San Francisco Chronicle, and the 2012 COWHORN Marsanne Roussanne was listed in David Schildknecht's Guide to the Best of 2013 on Robert Parker's Wine Advocate website. In addition, Robert Parkerâs The Wine Advocate rated five COWHORN wines 92+ points in 2013, after rating seven earlier vintages 91+ points in 2012. In 2011, the 2009 COWHORN Viognier was added to Paul Greguttâs Top 100 Pacific Northwest Wines list.
Sharing qualities comparable to the Chateauneuf-du-Pape region of Franceâs southern Rhone Valley, COWHORN sits alongside Southern Oregonâs pristine Applegate River. The farm is fringed by frontier forests and supported by soils that are perfectly suited for various classic, Rhone grape varieties, including Syrah, Grenache, Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne. As a result, COWHORN produces balanced, Rhone-style, fine wines with low alcohol and high aroma that express the signature subtleties of the farmâs unique soils.
Guided by horticulturist Alan York and consultant winemaker Ken Bernards, COWHORN planted its first eleven acres of vineyard in 2005. Using state-of-the-art technology, winemakers Bill and Barbara Steele gently and patiently nudge native yeast through the fermentation process on a mission to make fine wine with few inputs, going from grapes to glass as purely as possible.
COWHORN benefits from being surrounded by biodiversity that serves as a natural immune system for the vineyard and gardens. When combined with organic and Biodynamic farming methods, this symbiotic relationship not only minimizes the need for petrochemical pesticides but supports the vitality of the surrounding ecosystem. Over half of the estate is reserved for habitat, forest and riparian areas. Currently, the vineyard is 25 acres and lavender and produce account for 4 acres combined.
Because Biodynamic farming is deeply rooted in the practice of perennial polyculture, crops are selected that pair well in the field and on the table. COWHORN supplies 6,000-7,000 pounds of fresh asparagus to local markets and grocery stores. Depending on volumes and season, at certain times wine club members and tasting room visitors can purchase asparagus or orchard fruit. Other areas of development include our 1,000 lavender plants.

The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the farm.
The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory â the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldnât dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farmâs rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmerâs market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldnât see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. âI have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,â she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organicâs distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. âI want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.â
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Heleneâs interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. âIt gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit â even though it may look like others â has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,â said Helene.
â People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,â Helene commented. âIt is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.â She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. âI am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purÃ©es and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the farm.
The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory â the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldnât dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farmâs rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory â the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldnât dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farmâs rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmerâs market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldnât see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. âI have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,â she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organicâs distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. âI want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.â
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Heleneâs interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. âIt gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit â even though it may look like others â has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,â said Helene.
â People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,â Helene commented. âIt is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.â She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. âI am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purÃ©es and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

All of Emilianaâs work is aimed at a single conceptâexcellenceâand is guided by its high standards for production and the philosophy of seeking âharmony between the maximum quality of its wines and the respect for the environment.â They have met this enormous challenge by treating the vineyard as a living resource that must be respected and therefore practicing biodynamic, organic, and sustainable agriculture.
More than a decade ago, brothers JosÃ© and Rafael Guilisasti began the visionary process of converting a traditional Chilean winery into one that was 100% organic with minimal environmental impact through the practice of organic and biodynamic agriculture. Their goal objective was to create wines that would compete in quality with any wine in the world while respecting the cycles of nature. Now, a decade later, what began as a dream has become a complete and varied portfolio of the highest quality wines.
The tremendous quality obtained as the result of the inspiration in the origin of things, in coherence with the planetâs natural rhythms and activities, and its concern for energy efficiency and climate change, have resulted in one of the most complete organic portfolios in the world: Two standouts in their line of wines are GÃª, EmilianaÂ´s signature wine (Chile and Latin AmericaÂ´s first certified biodynamic wine), and COYAM, both produced with biodynamic grapes. Not to mention Signos de Origen, Novas and Adobe, all made from organic grapes.
Through all of their painstaking work, Emiliana Vineyards seeks to satisfy the demands of a new global consumer who values that which is pure, natural and made with respect for the environment, and appreciates over all the outstanding quality that only nature can achieve.
GÃª
After several decades and various generations working in the Chilean countryside, the Emiliana team wanted to pay tribute to the land by incorporating its presence in the name of a wine that would be produced under the strictest biodynamic management to achieve the maximum perfection. This gave rise to the idea of calling it GÃª, from ancient Greek, meaningland or âearthâ.
In GÃª, the energy of the cosmos, earth, and humankind come together in a unique wine with tremendous personality that faithfully reflects the characteristics and attributes of the terroir from which it comes.
HISTORY
Since its first vintage in 2003 the red blend GÃª has been made from the vineyards that have produced Emilianaâs most celebrated red wines year after year: the Syrah, Carmenere, and Cabernet Sauvignon from the Los Robles estate in the
Colchagua Valley.
The different varieties that go into this unique blend are fermented with native (wild) yeasts that vary from year to year, depending on the seasonâs weather conditions. GÃª is always based on Syrah, which represents approximately 50% of the blend. Carmenere is the second most important variety, followed by Cabernet Sauvignon. With its first vintage in 2003, released in 2005, GÃª became the first certified biodynamic wine in Chile, and indeed, all of Latin America.
TASTING NOTES:
Plum red with violet tones. The nose reveals itself little by little, starting with fresh notes recalling the countryside where the grapes were grown with notes of rosemary, lavender, and pennyroyal before opening elegantly to offer notes of ripe fruits such as black plums, blueberries, and blackberries along with a touch of spice and dark chocolate, coffee, and black pepper in honor of its time spent in the barrel. The harmonious palate is very fruity and has notes of liqueur. Its good volume and concentration, elegant tannins, and lively acidity, make this a wine with good aging potential.
FOOD PAIRING:
This wine has tremendous personality, character, and longevity. It is ideal with complex dishes such as grilled boar, venison, and wagyu beef with a variety of accompaniments.",,True,www.emiliana.bio,True

Eco Terreno Wines continues Mark Lyonâs, Owner and Winemaker, enthusiasm for making ultra-premium wines, while highlighting the vineyardsâ biodynamic farming methods.
In 1980, Mark bought the 122-acre vineyard founded in the 1970âs in the northern end of Alexander Valley near the town of Cloverdale with his father, Rusty Lyon. Under his management, 92 acres of the vineyard have been planted with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec, Sauvignon Blanc, Sauvignon MusquÃ©, Sauvignon Gris, SÃ©millon, and Chardonnay. Eco Terreno Vineyards has clients such as Sebastiani Vineyards, ChÃ¢teau St. Jean, Ferrari-Carano, Fetzerâs Bonterra, and Benzinger, some who make single-vineyard designated releases showcasing the quality of the vineyards. Today the Lyon and Cisne Vineyards at Eco Terreno are under the guidance of Daphne Amory, an expert in biodynamic viticulture. Eco Terreno Vineyards were certified as biodynamic by Demeter USA and as organic by Stellar in May 2017. Today, Eco Terreno is the largest, biodynamically farmed, contiguous vineyard in Alexander Valley.
In Spanish, âEcoâ is short for âecologiaâ and âTerrenoâ translates as âterrainâ or âland.â Eco Terreno is focused on promoting a healthy eco-system in the vineyard to grow quality grapes, and crafting them into wines that reflect the unique character of the vineyards. Our wines are made from 100% estate-grown grapes. Our logo with the bee/vine motif and our bee garden at the vineyard highlight our efforts in establishing a haven for bees, beautifying the vineyard, and protecting the environment.
Previously, Mark Lyon was the winemaker for Sebastiani Vineyards for 37 years. During his tenure at Sebastiani, Mark crafted the most 90+ point scored wines of any winemaker in Sonoma County. Many of those highly acclaimed wines used grapes from Eco Terreno Vineyards. Today he brings that expertise to Eco Terreno Wines; from the estate vineyard, Mark crafts a Cabernet Sauvignon, an Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon (from 40+ year old vines), the Three Vine Red, (a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot), a Barrel Aged Chardonnay, and the âCuvÃ©e Aceroâ Sauvignon Blanc.

The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the farm.
The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory â the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldnât dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farmâs rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory â the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldnât dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farmâs rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,
