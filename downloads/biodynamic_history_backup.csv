Seeing parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its environment became a key element of his approach.
This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the Brooks program from the beginning. “If the vine is happy, the grapes simply taste better.” Jimi once said, “I believe that farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of terroir.”
The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a disservice to them to use any other farming method that would intrude on what the earth provides.
Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.
Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks Wine. Winemaker friends who’d gathered at his memorial service compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimi’s philosophy. A dozen of Oregon’s top winemakers saw the 2004 vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimi’s assistant) became Head Winemaker; Jimi’s sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of Brooks’ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter farming.
Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooks’ story figured prominently in “American Wine Story,” a film about inspiration and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and we’re been able to increase the number of outside vineyards we’re able to source grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout the process.
The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look forward to your stopping by when you’re in the area.

The site of Duemani is in essence the discovery of a new and promising winegrowing region which offers us  the elements we have searched for to make significant and exciting wines.  The structure of the soil is remarkable for its predominance of clay and stone – the resulting low soil fertility leading to greater character and complexity in our vine’s fruit. After an examination of the property and its unique position in the contour of a west-facing amphitheatre there emerged the sites of our three distinct vineyards.  The vineyard at the highest altitude and with the richest soil is the site of our Cabernet Franc vines.  Another lower vineyard continues with the same varietal and then evolves into rows of Merlot vines. The third and smallest vineyard, notably stony and arid, is the ‘heart’ of the estate and is planted to 7000 vines of alberello-trained Syrah.In June of 2005 we planted yet another hectare of vines that will bring the total figure to more than 7 hectares of high-density planted vineyards.
From the very beginning we have followed the principles of Biodynamic farming and since the 2004 harvest our estate’s production of grapes proudly carries the certification of organic and Demeter certified Biodynamic.",,True,www.duemani.eu/,True

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,” said Helene.
“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

The micro-flora of the vineyards works harmoniously with the fauna, thus creating a complete circle. We harvest by hand, selecting only the best grapes for our wines. In the cellar, the winemaking process is completely natural, without any additives. Wines are aged in fifty percent new French, Hungarian and American oak. All wine is hand-crafted from beginning to end.
It is very difficult to find one person who believes in Biodynamic and organic agriculture and has the ""know-how"" of wine making process, yet at Beaver Creek we have been fortunate enough to bring together two such personalities: Martin and Joseph. Although each has a different background, they both share the common vision ""to make the best and the healthiest wines in the world.""
Beaver Creek Vineyards is located in Lake County, a truly unique corner of California. With the largest natural freshwater lake entirely in California, appropriately called Clear Lake, this county has been revered for centuries by the native populations of California, who prize the lake and its environs for their healing properties. Mount Konocti, an inactive volcano on the south shore of Clear Lake, gave the Lake County its volcanic soil and helped to create the area's lovely hills full of unspoiled vegetation and flora and its many hot springs, which have been long prized for their healing properties.
In the preface to his famous book, ""Wine, From Heaven on Earth,"" French Biodynamic winemaker Nicholas Joly writes the following: ""Biodynamic, wakes up in some the uncritical admiration, categorical dismissal in others, and yet an absolute misunderstanding in most.""
Beaver Creek uses the Biodynamic process to bring nature back in to balance. Biodynamic is not a method.  It is a direction that is one step beyond organic which we use to create an outstanding, original wine that is an expression of harmony between vines and winemaker. Just one look in a standard vineyard and a Biodynamic vineyard and it is easy to see the difference. A vineyard farmed in the standard way has dead soil, void of any micro creatures, bugs, limited vegetation, vines fortified by artificial fertilizers, sprayed by artificial herbicides.
On the other hand, a Biodynamic vineyard is rich in micro organisms, bugs and animals grazing on a variety of different plants that enrich the soil and the vines. Personal attention with a sense of unity or 'wholeness' with our universe creates a vineyard that is able to naturally express itself. We maintain a minimal impact on the environment and our natural surroundings.
Because of this, the wines don't bear the 'prescribed' taste and flavor of many others. Our wines are original, and we strive to produce a product of the cleanest, purest quality. We don't create our wines in the laboratory. The fragrance and taste of our wine comes only from the elements of nature. We use natural yeast, no filtration and the absolute minimum of amount of sulfites, so people sensitive to sulfites are usually not affected by our wine.
Please join us in promoting unity and balance between nature and humanity - from our vineyard to your table!

Seeing parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its environment became a key element of his approach.
This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the Brooks program from the beginning. “If the vine is happy, the grapes simply taste better.” Jimi once said, “I believe that farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of terroir.”
The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a disservice to them to use any other farming method that would intrude on what the earth provides.
Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.
Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks Wine. Winemaker friends who’d gathered at his memorial service compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimi’s philosophy. A dozen of Oregon’s top winemakers saw the 2004 vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimi’s assistant) became Head Winemaker; Jimi’s sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of Brooks’ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter farming.
Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooks’ story figured prominently in “American Wine Story,” a film about inspiration and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and we’re been able to increase the number of outside vineyards we’re able to source grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout the process.
The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look forward to your stopping by when you’re in the area.

Recently in 2013, the 2009 COWHORN Syrah was awarded Best of the West in Sunset Magazine, the 2009 COWHORN Reserve Syrah was named 50 Best Wines by Portland Monthly Magazine, the 2012 COWHORN Spiral 36 was listed on the 2013 Top 100 Wines by Jon Bonné and the San Francisco Chronicle, and the 2012 COWHORN Marsanne Roussanne was listed in David Schildknecht's Guide to the Best of 2013 on Robert Parker's Wine Advocate website. In addition, Robert Parker’s The Wine Advocate rated five COWHORN wines 92+ points in 2013, after rating seven earlier vintages 91+ points in 2012. In 2011, the 2009 COWHORN Viognier was added to Paul Gregutt’s Top 100 Pacific Northwest Wines list.
Sharing qualities comparable to the Chateauneuf-du-Pape region of France’s southern Rhone Valley, COWHORN sits alongside Southern Oregon’s pristine Applegate River. The farm is fringed by frontier forests and supported by soils that are perfectly suited for various classic, Rhone grape varieties, including Syrah, Grenache, Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne. As a result, COWHORN produces balanced, Rhone-style, fine wines with low alcohol and high aroma that express the signature subtleties of the farm’s unique soils.
Guided by horticulturist Alan York and consultant winemaker Ken Bernards, COWHORN planted its first eleven acres of vineyard in 2005. Using state-of-the-art technology, winemakers Bill and Barbara Steele gently and patiently nudge native yeast through the fermentation process on a mission to make fine wine with few inputs, going from grapes to glass as purely as possible.
COWHORN benefits from being surrounded by biodiversity that serves as a natural immune system for the vineyard and gardens. When combined with organic and Biodynamic farming methods, this symbiotic relationship not only minimizes the need for petrochemical pesticides but supports the vitality of the surrounding ecosystem. Over half of the estate is reserved for habitat, forest and riparian areas. Currently, the vineyard is 25 acres and lavender and produce account for 4 acres combined.
Because Biodynamic farming is deeply rooted in the practice of perennial polyculture, crops are selected that pair well in the field and on the table. COWHORN supplies 6,000-7,000 pounds of fresh asparagus to local markets and grocery stores. Depending on volumes and season, at certain times wine club members and tasting room visitors can purchase asparagus or orchard fruit. Other areas of development include our 1,000 lavender plants.

The small traditional family-run farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the farm.
The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www. cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,” said Helene.
“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,” said Helene.
“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

Amazing fruit taste, better nutrition with only 30 calories per serving, and no preservatives or colors; just clean, organic fruity goodness. From source to spread, Crofter’s great taste shines, and makes every day perfectly sweet!
Our motivation behind producing Biodynamic® spreads stems from our belief that food should be produced organically, in the most sustainable way possible, and benefit the environment. Since the founding of Crofter’s Organic, John Warner, M.Sc., P.Ag, has been integral to shaping our quality management programs. Warner grew up on his family’s local Biodynamic® farm, and still works the farm today. Using his knowledge of Biodynamic® principles and degree in environmental toxicology, Warner shaped Crofter’s early organic system, long before there were standardized USDA Organic regulations.

The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the farm.
The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic.

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,” said Helene.
“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

All of Emiliana’s work is aimed at a single concept—excellence—and is guided by its high standards for production and the philosophy of seeking “harmony between the maximum quality of its wines and the respect for the environment.” They have met this enormous challenge by treating the vineyard as a living resource that must be respected and therefore practicing biodynamic, organic, and sustainable agriculture.
More than a decade ago, brothers José and Rafael Guilisasti began the visionary process of converting a traditional Chilean winery into one that was 100% organic with minimal environmental impact through the practice of organic and biodynamic agriculture. Their goal objective was to create wines that would compete in quality with any wine in the world while respecting the cycles of nature. Now, a decade later, what began as a dream has become a complete and varied portfolio of the highest quality wines.
The tremendous quality obtained as the result of the inspiration in the origin of things, in coherence with the planet’s natural rhythms and activities, and its concern for energy efficiency and climate change, have resulted in one of the most complete organic portfolios in the world: Two standouts in their line of wines are Gê, Emiliana´s signature wine (Chile and Latin America´s first certified biodynamic wine), and COYAM, both produced with biodynamic grapes. Not to mention Signos de Origen, Novas and Adobe, all made from organic grapes.
Through all of their painstaking work, Emiliana Vineyards seeks to satisfy the demands of a new global consumer who values that which is pure, natural and made with respect for the environment, and appreciates over all the outstanding quality that only nature can achieve.
Gê
After several decades and various generations working in the Chilean countryside, the Emiliana team wanted to pay tribute to the land by incorporating its presence in the name of a wine that would be produced under the strictest biodynamic management to achieve the maximum perfection. This gave rise to the idea of calling it Gê, from ancient Greek, meaningland or “earth”.
In Gê, the energy of the cosmos, earth, and humankind come together in a unique wine with tremendous personality that faithfully reflects the characteristics and attributes of the terroir from which it comes.
HISTORY
Since its first vintage in 2003 the red blend Gê has been made from the vineyards that have produced Emiliana’s most celebrated red wines year after year: the Syrah, Carmenere, and Cabernet Sauvignon from the Los Robles estate in the
Colchagua Valley.
The different varieties that go into this unique blend are fermented with native (wild) yeasts that vary from year to year, depending on the season’s weather conditions. Gê is always based on Syrah, which represents approximately 50% of the blend. Carmenere is the second most important variety, followed by Cabernet Sauvignon. With its first vintage in 2003, released in 2005, Gê became the first certified biodynamic wine in Chile, and indeed, all of Latin America.
TASTING NOTES:
Plum red with violet tones. The nose reveals itself little by little, starting with fresh notes recalling the countryside where the grapes were grown with notes of rosemary, lavender, and pennyroyal before opening elegantly to offer notes of ripe fruits such as black plums, blueberries, and blackberries along with a touch of spice and dark chocolate, coffee, and black pepper in honor of its time spent in the barrel. The harmonious palate is very fruity and has notes of liqueur. Its good volume and concentration, elegant tannins, and lively acidity, make this a wine with good aging potential.
FOOD PAIRING:
This wine has tremendous personality, character, and longevity. It is ideal with complex dishes such as grilled boar, venison, and wagyu beef with a variety of accompaniments.",,True,www.emiliana.bio,True

As founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.
About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully unique condiment, which is still marketed.
In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”
La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.
With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.
Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and tastes,” said Helene.
“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, she is confident, will contribute special values to their culinary creations.
The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.",CA,,www.lavignefruits.com,

The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the farm.
The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the farm.
The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals and human beings.
Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.
The bees also make so many special contributions to their surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.
Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite comfortable together.
In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many people consider somewhat useless.
Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest populations in check.",NY,,www.cowberrycrossingfarm.com,

Our mission is to provide unconventionally grown food for the people of our local community. To us, unconventionally grown means we take a systems approach in our efforts to balance our food production with our responsibility for our local forest, field and river life and with the health of our planet. We work hard to minimum our use of off-farm and petroleum dependent inputs and practice a method of agriculture that strives to emulate a natural system. Fundamental to the success of our production system is the integration of animals for fertility and weed management, our selection of crops and cultivars for pest and disease control and our practice of “farmscaping” which provides habitat for native pollinators and natural predators of pests. We are Demeter Certified Biodynamic® as well as certified organic by Stellar Certification Services.
We are currently expanding our operations to provide a diversity of vegetable and fruit crops.  We have been selling our blueberries through First Alternative Cooperative Grocery in Corvallis since 2005 and in the fall of 2009 began offering fall storage crops – potatoes, onions, garlic and winter squash direct for sale to consumers.  2012 marked our first year of real diversification – we grew a number of different vegetable crops and enjoyed the first fruits of our young orchard – apples, pears, and plums.  This foray into diversified market farming was rounded out by attending the Corvallis Farmers’ Markets where we provided organically grown, Demeter certified Biodynamic® food to our customers.  It was truly a pleasure to see new faces become familiar and to share the fruits of our labor.  In 2014 you will again see us at the market and we will also be offering a number of ways to support the farm – as a market member, farmstand share, or box subscription.

About Our Pasta
At the heart of our Biodynamic Pasta is the wheat that is grown and harvested—under strict eco-safe values—in Southern Italy. Following generations of authentic Italian pasta-making, we utilize an authentic process. We begin with expertly milled semolina flour and cool, spring water, then extrude the dough with bronze dies. An artisanal method, extruding dough with bronze dies, creates a rougher surface making it easy to hug to your favorite sauces. The resulting pasta boasts that famous Italian fresh-bread flavor and al dente bite.
About Our Olive Oil
Grown and hand-harvested in lush orchards of Puglia, Italy, the olives that go into every bottle of our fresh, fruity extra-virgin olive oil are produced with the utmost care to the surrounding environment.

The farm has been Demeter certified Biodynamic® and Oregon Tilth certified Organic since 1987.
Over the years we have produced various berry crops (raspberries, strawberries, blackberries). Currently the farm produces numerous blackberry varieties and the production is processed on-farm generating a unique, award winning True Blackberry Vinegar. Our fruit production also is marketed as both fresh and frozen wholesale to processors and retailers.
In addition to producing the berries, the farm has always produced a range of medicinal herb crops  that rotate through the acreage, including the berry plantings. We have 2 commercial scale driers on-farm that dry herbs to order. Medicinal herbs are offered bulk wholesale both as fresh and dried.
The integration of the herb production with the production of fruit inspired the development of a unique Low Tillage Weed Control and Fertility System at Hoskins Berry Farm. Initiated by a Western SARE grant in the early 1990's the farm developed a ""mow and blow"" system where bulk organic materials are grown between the crop rows and then cut and blown into the crop row. This system has become the foundation of generating fertility on the farm and also serves as a primary on-farm source of weed control and water conservation.
Hoskins Berry Farm also supports (and is supported by) a herd of bright eyed Scottish Highland cattle, the off spring from which now adorn Biodynamic farms throughout the United States.

Beginning as negociants selling their first Hedges branded Columbia Valley wine to the Swedish government, the Hedges quickly realized the importance of site for producing great wines, and purchased a fifty-acre parcel on the dusty southwest slope of Red Mountain, a barely known growing region at the time. More than two decades later, their now 125 acres of Red Mountain vineyard land is the heart of the Hedges family’s wines.  The eldest born of Tom and Anne-Marie, Christophe, is general manager and head of international sales.  Their daughter, Sarah, is the head winemaker.
Farmers first, and winemakers second, the Hedges family believes there is nothing more important than expressing the characteristics of specific vineyards, of capturing Terroir.  Anne-Marie grew up in Champagne, France, and is no doubt the messenger of these beliefs, bringing the philosophies of the old world to her new home in eastern Washington State.  For more than a decade, the Hedges have chosen not to have their wines scored, as they believe this would hinder their pursuit of making wines of soul and truth.

Jessica had grown up around the organic “buzz” at home and as an adult has come to realize the health and overall benefits of the organic lifestyle. A recent university graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing and an Associates degree in Merchandising, Jessica brings much knowledge, skill and enthusiasm to the business.
OUR BIODYNAMIC FARMER
Our farmer, Fred Kirschenmann, converted to Biodynamic® farming from organic farming in 1982. His farm, just West of the James River in North Dakota, has been certified Biodynamic by the Demeter® Association for over 31 years! Not only has Fred been a dedicated Biodynamic® farmer, but he has also been a strong public and private advocate of organic farming – working with universities, extension agencies, local and federal government agencies and many others to further the growth of organic farming locally and nationwide. He has written many publications, books and hundreds of speeches in support of soil building and other farming practices that the organic and Biodynamic® farms embrace.
OUR MILLER
Our miller is Gary Thelen of Freeport, Minnesota. Gary is a third generation miller who took over the 100+ year old historic flour mill from his father, Walter. The mill has been in his family since 1903 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a young man, Gary worked on the family farm and was married to Sharon in 1982. In 1985 he began to focus more on the milling operation and in 1998 he completely took over the mill. Since then Gary has been carrying on and growing the family business. On December 27, 2011, two days after Christmas, Gary’s entire historic mill burned to the ground. With much encouragement from family, friends and business associates Gary rebuilt a new mill on the same site and struggled to rebuild his business.
HOW THE PUZZLE FITS TOGETHER
In the Fall of 2011 Lynda had an idea . . . what a great gift it would be to bring a Biodynamic Whole Wheat Flour into the world. And, as she shared this dream with her daughter, Jessica, the question arose, “What’s holding you back?” This simple question was the beginning of our journey to ISIS Biodynamic.
Lynda began to seek out a stone-grinding flour mill and luckily, through a friend in the industry, was able to locate one. We needed a place to put it and thought of Gary back in Freeport trying to recover from the fire. We asked Gary if he would house the mill and make our flour. He agreed and the mill was installed, inspected and certified by the Demeter Association.
Meanwhile Lynda and Jess had been making periodic visits to the Stone Barns Center for Agriculture in New York to see Fred Kirschenmann. We mentioned to Fred that we had purchased a mill and wanted to make Biodynamic® Whole Wheat Flour from his Wheat. Fred loved the idea and agreed to grow the Wheat for us.
The rest is history, or should we say, the future! We are also delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Whole Foods Market team, and appreciate their dedication and support of providing Biodynamic® products nationwide.
We truly hope ISIS Biodynamic® brings something delicious and fruitful to your kitchen and life!",CT,,www.isisbiodynamic.com,

For more than ten years, Monique Camp has stewarded Sophia’s Garden.   Her daily practice is three-fold: to ask what is needed, to listen, and then to take action. This was the way in which Sophia’s Garden was set in motion and how it continues to evolve.
In addition to offering Biodynamic Hydrosols, Essential Oils and dried medicinal herbs, this is a healing, teaching garden.

On the 10-acre property there are 7.5 acres planted to Pinot Noir grapes with the remaining acreage set aside for gardens. Within the gardens still remain a few hazelnut trees keeping the legacy alive. The Dundee Hills were formed between 6 and 17 million years ago by the Columbia River lava flows that made its way from the Oregon-Idaho border all the way to the coast. The lava solidified to form basalt. Over the years the rock weathered away in the high rainfalls of the Willamette Valley to form deep red clay soils. These volcanic soils are exceptionally good for growing grapes, particularly Pinot Noir.

Five generations of the Raymond family created a Napa icon, with an enduring reputation for elegant wines with a beautiful balance of finesse, power and complexity. Today, inspired by the vision of Proprietor Jean-Charles Boisset, Raymond is a dynamic destination dedicated to inspiring its guests’ passion for fine wine in an environment of exploration, creativity, and elegant whimsicality, where each in a series of diverse experiences progresses visitors into another world of discovery and exceptional wines. Further, Raymond’s Rutherford and St. Helena estate vineyards are certified organic and Biodynamic, and 100% of the winery’s power comes from renewable solar energy.

He saw the advantage of Biodynamic grown seed, and the need to bring Biodynamic farming practices and techniques to the US. The Biodynamic farms produced bountiful crops, and the seeds harvested from these crops had exceptional vigor. These farms were able to produce crops and seeds in a way that was much more “whole farm” sustainable than current organic practices. In fact, they were light years beyond. Tom often refers to Biodynamic as “beyond organic.”
Upon returning to the US, Tom began the process of certifying Territorial Seed’s organic farm as Biodynamic. Through a process that took over two years, the entire farm has achieved Stellar Organic certification and the coveted International Demeter Biodynamic Certification.
Territorial Seed Company is bringing Biodynamic vegetable seed to the home gardener through their new Sero Biodynamic Seed product line.

Our wines are inspired. We believe Oregon is a special place to make wine and we believe in our vineyards. We admire Burgundy, but we are not French and neither are our wines. We are not certain why we do everything we do, we can only say with confidence that we love wine and feel compelled to be involved.  The work of others in this field inspires us to continue our journey to produce Oregonian wines. In return we hope to inspire others with our work.
Rather than striving for a stylistic preference, we seek balance and energy in our wines. This energy is a mystery to us and we seek to understand and harness it. Our observations lead us to believe this energy exists in wines that are made from organic fruit sources combined with wild fermentations and minimal intervention. For this reason we farm our vineyards and craft our wines using organic and Biodynamic® methods.
We are educated in Enology, Viticulture, and International Business. Our training is used as a tool when needed. We work with determination, integrating our experience into the vineyard and winery to achieve harmony. Our method of work is largely philosophically based. Our decisions are guided by both instinct and observation. We believe that diversity in the biological ecosystem of the vineyard and winery is essential to achieve a true expression of terroir in wine.
Terroir is our guiding principle. We believe in letting nature take its course, but also view the dynamic of a vineyard and winery as being something that requires human involvement to form a unified system. Our goal is to understand and sustain the unity of this system in order to create original and compelling wines with a distinct sense of place. Our place is Johan Vineyards.

The French call it terroir, which refers to a sense of place, the sum of the geographical effects that influence the grape and in the end, the wine made from it. The Jacob-Hart Vineyard is no exception; it is an excellent storyteller if you know how to listen. Named in honor of REX HILL's founders, Jan Jacobsen & Paul Hart, the Jacob-Hart Vineyard was purchased in 1987. An old turkey farm, the land found tangible results growing grapes. Located on a warm southeast facing slope of the Chehalem Ridge, fruit at this vineyard is harvested a week or two before other REX HILL Pinot Noir sites. This beautiful vineyard offers both volcanic and sedimentary soils; to have both soil types in one vineyard is extremely unusual in the Willamette Valley. In places, the earth is so rocky that the vines were planted using a pickaxe instead of a shovel and it cannot be farmed with a tractor. These prized blocks produce the exceptional fruit that comprises Jacob-Hart Vineyard selections while most of the remainder provides the basic structure for our Reserve wines.",OR,True,www.rexhill.com/Winery---Vineyards/Jacob-Hart-Vineyard,

The vineyard is part of the Eola-Amity AVA (American Viticultural Area), a wine region blessed with the cooling afternoon Van Duzer Winds from the ocean during the warm ripening season. This helps retain good acidity and balance in the fruit we grow in the volcanic, shallow soils of the area.
Our story begins in 1989 when Craig and Gabriele Keeler were searching for properties to begin a new chapter in their lives and decided to take a walk through a picturesque hillside in Amity, Oregon. When Gabriele saw, on this long time abandoned, overgrown with blackberries, piece of land, the view to the south with views of Mary's Peak and Oregon's coastal mountains she grabbed Craig's hand and said ""CK, this is the place!"".  In 1990 the Keeler family moved to their 200 acre property and through many years of hard work they transformed what was once fields of blackberry's, rocky terrain and dilapidated structures to what is today; a home and Keeler Estate Vineyard.  It's a truly magical place consisting of a thriving biodynamic vineyard, gardens, forest, lakes, streams, acres of landscaping and plenty room for entertaining.  You'll not want to miss an opportunity to visit us during our annual open house.  Open by appointment or for special events only.  Contact Gabriele at info@keelerestatevineyard.com.

The farm is now the exclusive kitchen garden for world-renowned Manresa Restaurant (Los Gatos, California).
Cynthia Sandberg, owner and farmer, uses biodynamic and organic techniques to grow over 300 different cultivars of fruit, vegetables, herbs and edible flowers for the restaurant.  Beginning her work life as a trial attorney, Cynthia transitioned to farming after falling in love with gardening in her backyard on a bit more than one acre in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  Founding Love Apple in 2000, Cynthia started as a tomato plant grower and had a small tomato fruit stand on her Ben Lomond property.  In 2010, she purchased 22 acres on the former site of the Smothers Brothers Winery on Vine Hill Road in Santa Cruz and re-established her farm on the terraced hillside.
Achieving Demeter certification as a biodynamic farm in 2012 was a proud milestone for Love Apple.  Cynthia has spoken at numerous gardening and farming conferences and garden clubs, including the San Francisco Flower & Garden Show, Eco-Farm, MAD Symposium in Copenhagen and Nordic Barista Cup in Oslo, Norway.  Cynthia is a sought-after garden speaker on topics such as Mastering the Art of the Tomato, Introduction to Biodynamic Gardening, Farmer/Chef Relationships, and How to Make a Living from your Backyard Garden.  Cynthia can be contacted by emailing her at loveapplefarms@gmail.com
We give a number of fun and informative gardening and cooking classes at the farm during the year.  Topics covered have included “Tomato Seed Starting Class,""  ""Cheese-Making,"" Chicken-Keeping,""  ""Summer Vegetable Gardening,"" ""Container Vegetable Gardening,"" ""Bee-Keeping,"" Winter Vegetable Gardening,"" ""Simple Drip Irrigation System,"" and our popular ""Tomato Masters"" class for real tomato aficionados.
Love Apple Farms also offers off-site satellite workshops for organizations.  If you are interested in bringing the farm to your business or club for an on-site workshop, please contact us at loveapplefarms@gmail.com.
Love Apple Farms is home to the largest tomato plant sale in California, with well over 100 varieties of heirloom tomato seedlings each spring, from March to June.  Our retail greenhouse is at Ivy's Porch, located at 5311 Scotts Valley Drive, Scotts Valley, CA.

Light of Day Organic Farm and Tea Shop is a Northern Michigan company, located in gorgeous Leelanau County, just 8 miles West of historic downtown Traverse City. We are 8 miles from Lake Michigan, and are on the direct route (M-72 West) to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Our address is: 3502 E. Traverse Hwy. Traverse City, Michigan. Please visit our “Hours of Operation” page for seasonal visiting hours.
Our story
Light of Day Organics was founded by a Traverse City Mom named Angela Macke in 2003. Her background in Holistic health, (as both a Registered Nurse, Educator, and Horticulturalist), plus her own positive experience utilizing gentle, natural rhythms to successfully manage an auto-immune disease, plays an integral role in the thoughtful creation of each original product. Around here, we believe that a holistic approach is the most effective way to restore optimal health and a sense of well being. Helping our customers to create healthy lifestyle habits that support the prevention of illness, increase overall vitality, passion for life, and supporting the path to full actualization of  our full potential as human beings is our daily practice and intentional goal of our work.
Our Farm and production
Our products are Certified Organic and the Lion’s share (57%)  are grown right here on our certified Demeter Biodynamic farm in Traverse City under the guidelines of the National Organic Program, and Demeter U.S. The exceptionally high quality botanicals are hand-harvested, dried in our licensed commercial farm kitchen, then finish blended in small batches by hand to promote consistency, to maximize freshness and with the intention of offering them to you in their most pristine state. We hope that you enjoy the maximal nutritive benefits as Mother Nature intended.
Certifications and Process
We believe in honest tea and honest advertising here. This means supporting local and foreign farmers through certified (third-party verified, which includes annual audits) Fair Trade certified practices (Transfair USA) , growing and buying only 100% certified Organic (Stellar certification services and Demeter Biodynamic)  agricultural commodities.  Our teas and tisanes are Gluten-free.
Conscientious Packaging
We believe in presenting these products in their most natural, loose form. They have been packaged in lovely, domestically-manufactured, polished silver tins to protect them from the elements. We used a local designer, and local printer for soy-based ink labels and other packaging needs using Earth-friendly sustainable materials. We hand blend to completion in small batches, then package and label our teas right here in our farm kitchen.
Quality of Product / Quality of Life
We wanted to make sure that taste wasn’t the only thing to feel good about. Ensuring the highest quality of tea for you and life for those who bring it to us is part of our mission. We honor all of those involved in bringing this extremely labor-intensive crop from the fields to our cup by paying everyone a proper living wage and encouraging the spiritual sacredness of the family unit and community with time off from work to recharge and to play in this beautiful area that we are blessed to call “home”.
It is Light of Day’s sincere intention that you may enjoy balance and reach your full potential as a human being! We want for everyone to enjoy superb health, inner peace, joyfulness, and be on a well-lit path that will benefit the greater good with all that you do. We hope that you will discover, (and hopefully learn to cherish), the ancient and life-giving ritual of having a “spot of tea.”
For all of us here at Light of Day, tea is so more than an iced beverage to soothe your thirst in the Summertime, or to comfort your sore throat in the Wintertime.  We have come to appreciate that the commitment to daily self care  by taking time out to enjoy tea is a representative of the commitment and conscious choice  to live simply, and to live each day with a wonder and deep reverence for every created thing.
We really appreciate you taking the time to learn about us, and hope that you'll visit our Press Page to watch a PBS special where we were featured, ad well as read other good press.
Thank you.

Hood Organic Farm,541-352-7492,,"Specialty varieties of apples and pears grown at the foot of Mt Hood in Oregon's Hood River Valley. Irrigated with glacial water and picked at the peak of ripeness, our 7 varieties of pears and 43 varieties of apples are known for their superior flavor. We pack and ship our own fruit, which is sold directly at our farm in the fall, at farmers markets, to CSA's and to wholesalers who distribute our fruit across the country. We will soon be shipping packed gift boxes as well.
Although the farm dates to the turn of the century (the main farmhouse was built in 1904), John and Brady Jacobson began working the orchards in 1981. Inspired by European techniques and committed to sustainable land use, the Jacobsons undertook an extensi\ve orchard renovation and transition to organic farming that resulted in full organic certification in 1989 - the first farm in the valley to achieve this status. Numerous publications from The Oregonian to the Good Fruit Grower have written articles about the farm, and the BBC and PBS have also interviewed and filmed here.
As better reflects their view of the importance of the integration of the natural landscape and wildlife into their farming practices, and returning to the deeper origins of the organic movement, Brady and John have now become Biodynamic® growers. They also take pride in selling directly to loyal customers of the farm, as well as to regional markets, and donate a portion of their produce to School Aid®, a program in partnership with local markets and the Oregon Food Bank.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms is a unique, secluded, spectacular natural setting for hosting your one or two day weekend wedding retreat. Let your friends and families enjoy the most gorgeous mountain views (Mt Hood, Mt Adams & Mt Rainier) and gardens in the area and relax on our park-like grounds with orchards, fields, ponds, woods, and a lake. Lodging is available for up to six people in our Guest Cottage and Carriage House and maximum number of guests is 200.
The farm creates the feeling that for a day or two time has been stopped and rolled back to a different era. Unique and historic architecture in a magnificent setting coupled with fresh, organic, seasonal, farm-to-table dinners, prepared by our amazing chef make for a most memorable event. Dinners are served in our Apple House, a unique indoor/outdoor space with amazing views of Mt Hood, or on the lawn. Our staff is superb and the sense is one of family and connection.
Mt. Hood Organic Farms has been chosen twice as the Best Northwest Destination Wedding Site by Oregon Bride, and was designated this summer by MSN and The Knot as one of the most amazing wedding venues in the world. Our weddings have also been featured in numerous magazines and on blogs. You can also see more current information and photos from this season on Mt. Hood Organic Farms' Facebook page.

We make our own compost and preparations (homeopathic plant materials that stimulate plant growth and health), and we grow a diverse range of fruit and vegetables that thrive in the 12-month-a-year growing season of the Central Valley. Our commitment to Biodynamic® farming involves a spiritual component and some serious elbow grease. We also use Biodynamic® inspired Festival sprays to honor the earth that supports us.
We make our Biodynamic® and organic spirits in small batches using traditional copper-pot distillation. Our spirits are available for purchase on our website, along with raisins, almonds, and citrus (when in season).

We strive to preserve the nutritive value and vitality of every ingredient in our organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, low glycemic, kosher, raw, vegan/vegetarian, healthy and natural products. Many of our methodologies and formulations are entirely exclusive to the company.
We are mindful of where and how our ingredients are produced, closely monitor production methods, and recognize the impact of our business practices on the people we encounter, the lifestyles we influence, and the preservation of our planet. Omica Organics does not purchase products or ingredients on the common market, but works closely with growers and processors in the US and around the world to offer the best products in ways that promote health, sustainability, and eco-awareness. We are passionate about paying fair wages and prices, maintaining honesty and responsibility, and promoting respect and goodwill in our endeavors.
Omica Organics is directly associated with Sophia’s Gardens in Sebastopol, California, a biodynamically-run farm that grows for our company, and who researches and archives information on biodynamic farming techniques. Sophia’s Gardens is a single-family owned farm where crops are picked by hand and processed manually using age-old techniques that preserve the goodness of the plant. Our founder’s involvement with Anthroposophic research, biodynamic farming and water-flow technology (based on Rudolph Steiner and Viktor Schauberger’s works) spans 38+ years.
We contract with local farmers and ensure that they follow organic methodologies. We promote and buy organic only, inspiring farmers to follow organic practices, and encouraging manufacturers to promote organic farmers and farming techniques through economic need and markets. This not only supports farmers in the US, but helps to support an organic standard of industry in India and China. We purchase only from these organic farmers, then process without using synthetic solvents. We have partners on-site in these countries to verify adherence to strict organic standards.
Our proprietary stevia is cultivated from an extensive network of family-owned stevia farms. Self-sustaining farming methods help preserve the naturally-beneficial phytochemicals of the stevia leaf. The stevia leaves are picked by hand at the peak of the growing season, then dried naturally using sunlight and fresh air. The support we provide helps to keep these historically significant farming practices from disappearing completely.
We use no fillers or artificial ingredients and all capsules are non-gelatin vegetarian. No synthetic preservatives are found in our products. We use organic vegetable glycerin (made fresh specifically for our use; and not sourced from industrial byproducts) along with organic biodynamic grape alcohol to preserve our products when necessary.
We endeavor to uphold eco-friendly office and shipping practices. For instance, the popcorn used in our shipping packaging is a biodegradable cornstarch product that breaks down completely within 2 months. Our paperless practices preserve trees, we print on the backs of used paper whenever feasible, and we recycle everything possible including shredded documents, food and drink containers, and toner/ink cartridges.  One of our US offices, located in an appropriately sunny climate, is completely solar powered, helping to reduce ozone emissions, and save trees that produce life-giving oxygen.

We strive to preserve the nutritive value and vitality of every ingredient in our organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, low glycemic, kosher, raw, vegan/vegetarian, healthy and natural products. Many of our methodologies and formulations are entirely exclusive to the company.
We are mindful of where and how our ingredients are produced, closely monitor production methods, and recognize the impact of our business practices on the people we encounter, the lifestyles we influence, and the preservation of our planet. Omica Organics does not purchase products or ingredients on the common market, but works closely with growers and processors in the US and around the world to offer the best products in ways that promote health, sustainability, and eco-awareness. We are passionate about paying fair wages and prices, maintaining honesty and responsibility, and promoting respect and goodwill in our endeavors.
Omica Organics is directly associated with Sophia’s Gardens in Sebastopol, California, a biodynamically-run farm that grows for our company, and who researches and archives information on biodynamic farming techniques. Sophia’s Gardens is a single-family owned farm where crops are picked by hand and processed manually using age-old techniques that preserve the goodness of the plant. Our founder’s involvement with Anthroposophic research, biodynamic farming and water-flow technology (based on Rudolph Steiner and Viktor Schauberger’s works) spans 38+ years.
We contract with local farmers and ensure that they follow organic methodologies. We promote and buy organic only, inspiring farmers to follow organic practices, and encouraging manufacturers to promote organic farmers and farming techniques through economic need and markets. This not only supports farmers in the US, but helps to support an organic standard of industry in India and China. We purchase only from these organic farmers, then process without using synthetic solvents. We have partners on-site in these countries to verify adherence to strict organic standards.
Our proprietary stevia is cultivated from an extensive network of family-owned stevia farms. Self-sustaining farming methods help preserve the naturally-beneficial phytochemicals of the stevia leaf. The stevia leaves are picked by hand at the peak of the growing season, then dried naturally using sunlight and fresh air. The support we provide helps to keep these historically significant farming practices from disappearing completely.
We use no fillers or artificial ingredients and all capsules are non-gelatin vegetarian. No synthetic preservatives are found in our products. We use organic vegetable glycerin (made fresh specifically for our use; and not sourced from industrial byproducts) along with organic biodynamic grape alcohol to preserve our products when necessary.
We endeavor to uphold eco-friendly office and shipping practices. For instance, the popcorn used in our shipping packaging is a biodegradable cornstarch product that breaks down completely within 2 months. Our paperless practices preserve trees, we print on the backs of used paper whenever feasible, and we recycle everything possible including shredded documents, food and drink containers, and toner/ink cartridges.  One of our US offices, located in an appropriately sunny climate, is completely solar powered, helping to reduce ozone emissions, and save trees that produce life-giving oxygen.

Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and finally to California’s Silicon Valley. After starting his own companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines held more interest for Barbara every day.
Biodiversity
Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard areas, providing weed control for us – and entertainment for the neighbors.
A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.
Energy Conservation
Puma Springs’ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system provides all hot water for the office.
Terroir
Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.
Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. Biodynamics is not only good for the earth and good for the environment; it helps produce exceptional wine grapes.
