            'spent time in France, where he worked with wineries who were '
            'using biodynamic farming principles in their vineyards. Seeing '
            'parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting '
            'healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon '
            'and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  '
            'in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its '
            'environment became a key element of his approach.\n'
            'This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the '
            'Brooks program from the beginning. “If the vine is happy, the '
            'grapes simply taste better.” Jimi once said, “I believe that '
            'farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem '
            'intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of '
            'terroir.”\n'
            'The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in '
            'the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot '
            'Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other '
            'cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir '
            'in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a '
            'disservice to them to use any other farming method that would '
            'intrude on what the earth provides.\n'
            'Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified '
            'until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These '
            'vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the '
            'oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this '
            'vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the '
            'essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.\n'
            'Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away '
            'at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks '
            'Wine. Winemaker friends who’d gathered at his memorial service '
            'compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimi’s '
            'philosophy. A dozen of Oregon’s top winemakers saw the 2004 '
            'vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimi’s assistant) '
            'became Head Winemaker; Jimi’s sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took '
            'over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of '
            'Brooks’ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these '
            'values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no '
            'surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything '
            'in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter '
            'farming.\n'
            'Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a '
            'dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in '
            'all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooks’ story figured '
            'prominently in “American Wine Story,” a film about inspiration '
            'and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals '
            'around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will '
            'be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and we’re been able to '
            'increase the number of outside vineyards we’re able to source '
            'grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that '
            'they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout '
            'the process.\n'
            'The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look '
            'forward to your stopping by when you’re in the area.\n'

            'an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to '
            'waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of '
            'preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. '
            'The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully '

            'moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle '
            'in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado '
            'farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit '
            'crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove '

            'Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, '
            'Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, '
            'Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also '

            'The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming '

            'not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and '

            'Beaver Creek Vineyards is located in Lake County, a truly unique '
            'corner of California. With the largest natural freshwater lake '
            'entirely in California, appropriately called Clear Lake, this '
            'county has been revered for centuries by the native populations '
            'of California, who prize the lake and its environs for their '
            'healing properties. Mount Konocti, an inactive volcano on the '
            'south shore of Clear Lake, gave the Lake County its volcanic soil '
            "and helped to create the area's lovely hills full of unspoiled "
            'vegetation and flora and its many hot springs, which have been '
            'long prized for their healing properties.\n'
            'In the preface to his famous book, "Wine, From Heaven on Earth," '
            'French Biodynamic winemaker Nicholas Joly writes the following: '
            '"Biodynamic, wakes up in some the uncritical admiration, '
            'categorical dismissal in others, and yet an absolute '
            'misunderstanding in most."\n'
            'Beaver Creek uses the Biodynamic process to bring nature back in '
            'to balance. Biodynamic is not a method.  It is a direction that '
            'is one step beyond organic which we use to create an outstanding, '
            'original wine that is an expression of harmony between vines and '
            'winemaker. Just one look in a standard vineyard and a Biodynamic '
            'vineyard and it is easy to see the difference. A vineyard farmed '
            'in the standard way has dead soil, void of any micro creatures, '
            'bugs, limited vegetation, vines fortified by artificial '
            'fertilizers, sprayed by artificial herbicides.\n'
            'On the other hand, a Biodynamic vineyard is rich in micro '
            'organisms, bugs and animals grazing on a variety of different '
            'plants that enrich the soil and the vines. Personal attention '
            "with a sense of unity or 'wholeness' with our universe creates a "
            'vineyard that is able to naturally express itself. We maintain a '
            'minimal impact on the environment and our natural surroundings.\n'
            "Because of this, the wines don't bear the 'prescribed' taste and "
            'flavor of many others. Our wines are original, and we strive to '

 'profile': 'Brooks Winery came to life in 1998, after founder Jimi Brooks had '
            'spent time in France, where he worked with wineries who were '
            'using biodynamic farming principles in their vineyards. Seeing '
            'parallels between the use of these processes and the resulting '
            'healthier, better-tasting fruit, so when he returned to Oregon '
            'and started his own label, the awareness that everything growing  '
            'in the ground is a reflection of everything else in its '
            'environment became a key element of his approach.\n'
            'This sense of vineyard transparency has been at the heart of the '
            'Brooks program from the beginning. “If the vine is happy, the '
            'grapes simply taste better.” Jimi once said, “I believe that '
            'farming in this way, by keeping the earth alive and the ecosystem '
            'intact, is the only way to really achieve that concept of '
            'terroir.”\n'
            'The benefits of biodynamic farming are particularly noticeable in '
            'the production of our primary grape varieties, Riesling and Pinot '
            'Noir. We believe that, more than with virtually any other '
            'cultivar, these varieties have the ability to reflect the terroir '
            'in which they were grown to an extent that it would be a '
            'disservice to them to use any other farming method that would '
            'intrude on what the earth provides.\n'
            'Although the Brooks estate vineyard was not Demeter certified '
            'until 2012, the practices have been in place since 2002. These '
            'vines were planted between 1973 and 1977, making them among the '
            'oldest vines in the Willamette Valley. 10 acres of vines in this '
            'vineyard are planted on their own rootstock, increasing the '
            'essence of purity in the fruit harvested from this site.\n'
            'Life too, like a vineyard, has a cycle. In 2004, Jimi passed away '
            'at age 38, leaving his young son Pascal as sole owner of Brooks '
            'Wine. Winemaker friends who’d gathered at his memorial service '
            'compelled the family to carry on the winery and Jimi’s '
            'philosophy. A dozen of Oregon’s top winemakers saw the 2004 '
            'vintage through, and in 2005, Chris Williams (Jimi’s assistant) '
            'became Head Winemaker; Jimi’s sister, Janie Brooks Heuck, took '
            'over the role of Managing Director, completing the circle of '
            'Brooks’ core values of friendship, family and spirit. That these '
            'values are reflected in the way our farming is handled is no '
            'surprise; our appreciation of the interrelatedness of everything '
            'in life is why we are so attuned to the precepts of Demeter '
            'farming.\n'
            'Over the past few years, our Ara Riesling has been featured at a '
            'dinner at The White House, and our wines have won accolades in '
            'all corners of the wine world. Jimi Brooks’ story figured '
            'prominently in “American Wine Story,” a film about inspiration '
            'and compulsion that was well received at film and wine festivals '
            'around the country. We have a new winemaking facility that will '
            'be in place in time for the 2014 harvest, and we’re been able to '
            'increase the number of outside vineyards we’re able to source '
            'grape from, and our relationship with these growers is such that '
            'they allow us to be involved in the farming decision throughout '
            'the process.\n'
            'The Brooks tasting room is open all year-round, so we look '
            'forward to your stopping by when you’re in the area.\n'

 'profile': 'As a visionary, I take unusual fruit, without much of a market '
            'potential, and create exciting and innovative condiments. As '
            'founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified '
            'Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh '
            'flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste '
            'my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy '
            'them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.\n'
            'About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the '
            'fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With '
            'an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to '
            'waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of '
            'preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. '
            'The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully '
            'unique condiment, which is still marketed.\n'
            'In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable '
            'line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, '
            'but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these '
            'books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged '
            'a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for '
            'nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne '
            'products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, '
            'has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s '
            'distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits '
            'certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our '
            'label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”\n'
            'La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert '
            'moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle '
            'in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado '
            'farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit '
            'crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove '
            'is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, '
            'persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.\n'
            'With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower '
            'of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious '
            'sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet '
            'condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are '
            'Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, '
            'Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, '
            'Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also '
            'produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.\n'
            'Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can '
            'make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients '
            'makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. '
            'The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming '
            'methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of '
            'accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may '
            'look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers '
            'not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and '
            'tastes,” said Helene.\n'
            '“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best '
            'medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming '
            'practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add '
            'nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also '
            'encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, '
            'she is confident, will contribute special values to their '
            'culinary creations.\n'
            'The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity '
            'and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on '
            'fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy '
            'to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits '
            'and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.',

 'profile': 'Cowberry Crossing Farm is located on fifty acres in Claverack, '
            'New York.  The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed '
            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

            'founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified '
            'Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh '
            'flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste '
            'my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy '
            'them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.\n'
            'About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the '
            'fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With '
            'an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to '
            'waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of '
            'preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. '
            'The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully '
            'unique condiment, which is still marketed.\n'
            'In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable '
            'line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, '
            'but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these '
            'books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged '
            'a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for '
            'nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne '
            'products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, '
            'has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s '
            'distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits '
            'certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our '
            'label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”\n'
            'La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert '
            'moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle '
            'in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado '
            'farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit '
            'crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove '
            'is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, '
            'persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.\n'
            'With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower '
            'of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious '
            'sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet '
            'condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are '
            'Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, '
            'Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, '
            'Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also '
            'produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.\n'
            'Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can '
            'make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients '
            'makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. '
            'The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming '
            'methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of '
            'accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may '
            'look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers '
            'not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and '
            'tastes,” said Helene.\n'
            '“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best '
            'medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming '
            'practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add '
            'nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also '
            'encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, '
            'she is confident, will contribute special values to their '
            'culinary creations.\n'
            'The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity '
            'and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on '
            'fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy '
            'to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits '
            'and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.',

            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

 'profile': 'As a visionary, I take unusual fruit, without much of a market '
            'potential, and create exciting and innovative condiments. As '
            'founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified '
            'Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh '
            'flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste '
            'my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy '
            'them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.\n'
            'About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the '
            'fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With '
            'an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to '
            'waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of '
            'preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. '
            'The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully '
            'unique condiment, which is still marketed.\n'
            'In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable '
            'line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, '
            'but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these '
            'books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged '
            'a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for '
            'nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne '
            'products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, '
            'has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s '
            'distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits '
            'certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our '
            'label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”\n'
            'La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert '
            'moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle '
            'in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado '
            'farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit '
            'crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove '
            'is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, '
            'persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.\n'
            'With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower '
            'of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious '
            'sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet '
            'condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are '
            'Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, '
            'Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, '
            'Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also '
            'produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.\n'
            'Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can '
            'make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients '
            'makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. '
            'The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming '
            'methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of '
            'accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may '
            'look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers '
            'not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and '
            'tastes,” said Helene.\n'
            '“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best '
            'medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming '
            'practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add '
            'nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also '
            'encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, '
            'she is confident, will contribute special values to their '
            'culinary creations.\n'
            'The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity '
            'and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on '
            'fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy '
            'to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits '
            'and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.',

            'New York.  The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed '
            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

            'sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet '
            'condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are '
            'Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, '
            'Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, '
            'Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also '
            'produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.\n'
            'Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can '
            'make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients '
            'makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. '
            'The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming '
            'methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of '
            'accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may '
            'look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers '
            'not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and '
            'tastes,” said Helene.\n'
            '“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best '
            'medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming '
            'practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add '
            'nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also '
            'encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, '
            'she is confident, will contribute special values to their '
            'culinary creations.\n'
            'The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity '
            'and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on '
            'fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy '
            'to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits '
            'and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.',

 'profile': 'Cowberry Crossing Farm is located on fifty acres in Claverack, '
            'New York.  The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed '
            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

 'profile': 'Cowberry Crossing Farm is located on fifty acres in Claverack, '
            'New York.  The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed '
            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

            'Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh '

 'profile': 'Cowberry Crossing Farm is located on fifty acres in Claverack, '
            'New York.  The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed '
            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

            'Now, a decade later, what began as a dream has become a complete '

            'After several decades and various generations working in the '
            'Chilean countryside, the Emiliana team wanted to pay tribute to '
            'the land by incorporating its presence in the name of a wine that '
            'would be produced under the strictest biodynamic management to '
            'achieve the maximum perfection. This gave rise to the idea of '
            'calling it Gê, from ancient Greek, meaningland or “earth”.\n'
            'In Gê, the energy of the cosmos, earth, and humankind come '
            'together in a unique wine with tremendous personality that '
            'faithfully reflects the characteristics and attributes of the '
            'terroir from which it comes.\n'
            'HISTORY\n'
            'Since its first vintage in 2003 the red blend Gê has been made '
            'from the vineyards that have produced Emiliana’s most celebrated '
            'red wines year after year: the Syrah, Carmenere, and Cabernet '
            'Sauvignon from the Los Robles estate in the\n'
            'Colchagua Valley.\n'
            'The different varieties that go into this unique blend are '
            'fermented with native (wild) yeasts that vary from year to year, '
            'depending on the season’s weather conditions. Gê is always based '
            'on Syrah, which represents approximately 50% of the blend. '
            'Carmenere is the second most important variety, followed by '
            'Cabernet Sauvignon. With its first vintage in 2003, released in '
            '2005, Gê became the first certified biodynamic wine in Chile, and '
            'indeed, all of Latin America.\n'
            'TASTING NOTES:\n'
            'Plum red with violet tones. The nose reveals itself little by '
            'little, starting with fresh notes recalling the countryside where '
            'the grapes were grown with notes of rosemary, lavender, and '
            'pennyroyal before opening elegantly to offer notes of ripe fruits '
            'such as black plums, blueberries, and blackberries along with a '
            'touch of spice and dark chocolate, coffee, and black pepper in '
            'honor of its time spent in the barrel. The harmonious palate is '
            'very fruity and has notes of liqueur. Its good volume and '
            'concentration, elegant tannins, and lively acidity, make this a '
            'wine with good aging potential.\n'
            'FOOD PAIRING:\n'
            'This wine has tremendous personality, character, and longevity. '
            'It is ideal with complex dishes such as grilled boar, venison, '
            'and wagyu beef with a variety of accompaniments.',

            'founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified '
            'Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh '
            'flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste '
            'my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy '
            'them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.\n'
            'About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the '
            'fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With '
            'an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to '
            'waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of '
            'preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. '
            'The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully '
            'unique condiment, which is still marketed.\n'
            'In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable '
            'line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, '
            'but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these '
            'books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged '
            'a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for '
            'nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne '
            'products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, '
            'has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s '
            'distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits '
            'certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our '
            'label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”\n'
            'La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert '
            'moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle '
            'in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado '
            'farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit '
            'crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove '
            'is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, '
            'persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.\n'
            'With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower '
            'of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious '
            'sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet '
            'condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are '
            'Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, '
            'Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, '
            'Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also '
            'produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.\n'
            'Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can '
            'make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients '
            'makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. '
            'The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming '
            'methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of '
            'accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may '
            'look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers '
            'not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and '
            'tastes,” said Helene.\n'
            '“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best '
            'medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming '
            'practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add '
            'nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also '
            'encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, '
            'she is confident, will contribute special values to their '
            'culinary creations.\n'
            'The diverse food industry constantly changes, demanding ingenuity '
            'and new ideas. Helene Beck and La Vigne are setting the world on '
            'fire with their fresh fruit and condiments. “I am proud and happy '
            'to enjoy two roles, as an organic grower of fine, fresh fruits '
            'and also a developer of condiments, purées and dried snacks.',

            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '

            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '

            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '

            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

 'profile': 'As a visionary, I take unusual fruit, without much of a market '
            'potential, and create exciting and innovative condiments. As '
            'founder and principal of La Vigne Organics, and a Certified '
            'Organic Grower, the fruit that I grow has an unmistakably fresh '
            'flavor. The organic process enhances the flavor. When they taste '
            'my sample oranges at the farmer’s market they come back and buy '
            'them. My oranges have a sweeter flavor.\n'
            'About eighteen years ago I decided to make products from the '
            'fruit that my husband, Robert, and I grow on our property. With '
            'an abundance of persimmons and kumquats I couldn’t see go to '
            'waste I began my line of condiments. Thus, in the spirit of '
            'preservation, my first product, dried persimmons, was created. '
            'The second product was Kumquat Piquant Sauce, a delightfully '
            'unique condiment, which is still marketed.\n'
            'In the Beck home, cookbooks from almost every culture imaginable '
            'line the walls of the study. Helene not only owns these books, '
            'but is also a voracious reader and uses ideas garnered from these '
            'books to create her innovative line of condiments. “I have merged '
            'a long-time interest in multi-cultural cuisine with a passion for '
            'nutrition and a lifetime of gourmet cooking into La Vigne '
            'products,” she said. That, coupled with a commitment to ecology, '
            'has contributed to the development of La Vigne Organic’s '
            'distinctive line of gourmet foods made entirely from fruits '
            'certified organic by CCOF. “I want consumers to remember our '
            'label as a symbol of wonderful tastes leading to good health.”\n'
            'La Vigne Enterprises was founded in 1994, after Helene and Robert '
            'moved to North County San Diego to pursue a healthful lifestyle '
            'in a beautiful rural area. They converted a neglected avocado '
            'farm into an abundant grove, producing fifteen different fruit '
            'crops, all of which are one hundred percent organic. Their grove '
            'is devoted to less-mainstream fruits, including kumquats, '
            'persimmons, cherimoyas, minneolas and blood oranges.\n'
            'With Helene’s interest in exotic foods and as an organic grower '
            'of tree fruits, she found the opportunity to create delicious '
            'sauces, conserves and condiments from the fruit. The gourmet '
            'condiments Helene has created under the La Vigne label are '
            'Kumquat Conserve, Kumquat Piquant Sauce, Kumquat Ginger Syrup, '
            'Blood Orange Syrup, Persimmon Salsa, Persimmon Salad Dressing, '
            'Persimmon Chipotle and Dried Fuyu Persimmons. La Vigne also '
            'produces purees and juices from the kumquat and the persimmon.\n'
            'Helene believes that with good, fresh food to start with, you can '
            'make tasty dishes. The quality of the soil and its nutrients '
            'makes a considerable difference in the flavor of the food grown. '
            'The Becks use natural fertilizers and traditional organic farming '
            'methods to enrich their land. “It gives me a great feeling of '
            'accomplishment when I hear that our fruit – even though it may '
            'look like others – has a quality and taste that leads consumers '
            'not only to want more but to experiment with new textures and '
            'tastes,” said Helene.\n'
            '“ People are becoming aware that good food is their best '
            'medicine, and I feel I can help in a small way through my farming '
            'practices,” Helene commented. “It is my goal to continue to add '
            'nutritional value and taste to all our fruits.” She also '
            'encourages chefs to seek out the La Vigne organic line, which, '
            'she is confident, will contribute special values to their '
            'culinary creations.\n'

 'profile': 'Cowberry Crossing Farm is located on fifty acres in Claverack, '
            'New York.  The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed '
            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

 'profile': 'Cowberry Crossing Farm is located on fifty acres in Claverack, '
            'New York.  The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed '
            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

 'profile': 'Cowberry Crossing Farm is located on fifty acres in Claverack, '
            'New York.  The farmers, Richard & Cecile Harrison are committed '
            'to local, humane, sustainable farming and the farm is certified '
            'both organic and biodynamic.  The small traditional family-run '
            'farm has a large and varied vegetable garden providing especially '
            'high quality produce for our customers.  Animals found on the '
            'farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, rabbits, sheep, pigs, '
            'cows, horses, cats, bees, and Glory, the border collie.  All are '
            'fed organic feed and spend their days roaming freely on the '
            'farm.\n'
            'The many facets of Biodynamics can be experienced directly at '
            'Cowberry Crossing farm.  Biodynamic agriculture was the first '
            'ecological farming system to arise in response to commercial '
            'fertilizers and specialized agriculture.  It is the highest '
            'standard of organic and sustainable farming yielding maximum soil '
            'health.  Optimum soil health fosters a healthier environment and '
            'more nutritious plants which of course lead to healthier animals '
            'and human beings.\n'
            'Animals found on the farm include chickens, ducks, turkeys, '
            'rabbits, sheep, pigs, cows, horses, cats, bees, and our latest '
            'addition, Glory – the border collie.  The ideal Biodynamic farm '
            'should strive to be home to five primary farm animals: cows, '
            'sheep, chickens, horses, and pigs.  Each of these amazing '
            'creatures make unique and vital contributions to the balance and '
            'health of the farm in terms of the way that they eat from the '
            'land, the nourishing of the soil from their manure, pest control, '
            'weed control, aeration of soil, and much more.\n'
            'The bees also make so many special contributions to their '
            'surroundings.  Perhaps one of the more noticeable benefits of '
            'keeping bees on the farm is the increase in produce yields due to '
            'their pollinating as they gather nectar and pollen.\n'
            'Humane treatment dictates that the animals are able to live as '
            'closely as possible to their natural rhythms and instincts in a '
            'stress-free environment with the highest quality food we can '
            'offer.  All the animals are pastured or free-roaming.  Even the '
            'rabbits (this is not easy!).  We wouldn’t dream of maiming an '
            'animal for convenience of production.  Our cows have horns and '
            'tails, our sheep and pigs have tails, our chickens have beaks.  '
            'All of the animals enjoy the calming influence associated with '
            'the companionship of their own kind.  This is particularly '
            'important to raising stress-free herd animals.   The young of all '
            'farm animal remain with their mothers until natural weaning '
            'occurs, starting their lives stress-free and with the best '
            'nutrition that nature intended.  Sometimes different farm animals '
            'will intermix!  The cats have been seen playing with the horses '
            'and snuggling with the lambs.  Chicks and rabbits are also quite '
            'comfortable together.\n'
            'In an effort to learn more about and care for the wildlife of the '
            'farm, we have encouraged the on-farm research of local '
            'biologists, Conrad and Claudia Vispo (founders of the Farmscape '
            'Ecology Program).  To our surprise and delight, they have found '
            'two quite rare creatures living on the farm:  the bronze copper '
            'butterfly and the leopard frog.  Both of these species depend on '
            'the wet meadows habitat of the farm which, at first glance, many '
            'people consider somewhat useless.\n'
            'Other wildlife spotted on the farm include deer, raccoon, coyote, '
            'the American bald eagle,  opossum, squirrel, rabbit, fox, duck, '
            'turkey, red-tail hawks, owls, bats, fire flies, pheasant, bobcat, '
            'and countless varieties of  bird.  It is important to leave '
            'portions of farmland wild as homes for these creatures.  While '
            'some wild animals can be an occasional nuisance to farming, they '
            'also can greatly contribute to a healthy farm organism.  For '
            'example, wild animals keep the farm’s rodent and insect pest '
            'populations in check.',

            'agriculture that strives to emulate a natural system. Fundamental '
            'to the success of our production system is the integration of '
            'animals for fertility and weed management, our selection of crops '
            'and cultivars for pest and disease control and our practice of '
            '“farmscaping” which provides habitat for native pollinators and '
            'natural predators of pests. We are Demeter Certified Biodynamic® '
            'as well as certified organic by Stellar Certification Services.\n'
            'We are currently expanding our operations to provide a diversity '
            'of vegetable and fruit crops.  We have been selling our '
            'blueberries through First Alternative Cooperative Grocery in '
            'Corvallis since 2005 and in the fall of 2009 began offering fall '
            'storage crops – potatoes, onions, garlic and winter squash direct '
            'for sale to consumers.  2012 marked our first year of real '
            'diversification – we grew a number of different vegetable crops '
            'and enjoyed the first fruits of our young orchard – apples, '
            'pears, and plums.  This foray into diversified market farming was '
            'rounded out by attending the Corvallis Farmers’ Markets where we '
            'provided organically grown, Demeter certified Biodynamic® food to '
            'our customers.  It was truly a pleasure to see new faces become '
            'familiar and to share the fruits of our labor.  In 2014 you will '
            'again see us at the market and we will also be offering a number '
            'of ways to support the farm – as a market member, farmstand '
            'share, or box subscription.\n'

            'offering true authentic Italian foods with integrity and '
            'consistency. In the mid-1940s, Mr. George DeLallo began selling '
            'Italian grocery items door-to-door in the immigrant neighborhoods '
            'of Western Pennsylvania. In 1954, he and his wife Madeline '
            'established a grocery store in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, which '
            'specialized in authentic Italian foods. Soon after, they began to '
            'develop and sell traditional Italian products under the DeLallo '
            'name.\n'
            'As the years progressed, the retail and wholesale businesses '
            'grew. In the 1980s, DeLallo pioneered the olive and antipasti bar '
            'concept, which has become a staple of grocery stores around the '
            'U.S. and has revolutionized the American consumer’s experience of '
            'table olives and antipasti.\n'
            'Today, DeLallo’s original Jeannette retail store remains a '
            'vibrant and beloved part of the community and DeLallo products '
            'are distributed throughout the country. Whether it is found on '
            'traditional Italian grocery items such as olive oil, pasta, '
            'vinegars and tomatoes, or on our complete line of cured olives '
            'and antipasti, the DeLallo label guarantees consumers '
            'authenticity, integrity, and consistency.\n'
            'About Our Pasta\n'
            'At the heart of our Biodynamic Pasta is the wheat that is grown '
            'and harvested—under strict eco-safe values—in Southern Italy. '
            'Following generations of authentic Italian pasta-making, we '
            'utilize an authentic process. We begin with expertly milled '
            'semolina flour and cool, spring water, then extrude the dough '
            'with bronze dies. An artisanal method, extruding dough with '
            'bronze dies, creates a rougher surface making it easy to hug to '
            'your favorite sauces. The resulting pasta boasts that famous '
            'Italian fresh-bread flavor and al dente bite.\n'
            'About Our Olive Oil\n'
            'Grown and hand-harvested in lush orchards of Puglia, Italy, the '
            'olives that go into every bottle of our fresh, fruity '
            'extra-virgin olive oil are produced with the utmost care to the '
            'surrounding environment. Our Biodynamic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is '
            'created from the first, cold press of Italian-grown olives to '
            'maintain its rich olive flavor: robust and fruity with a light, '
            'peppery finish.',

            'At the heart of our Biodynamic Pasta is the wheat that is grown '

            'Following generations of authentic Italian pasta-making, we '

            'semolina flour and cool, spring water, then extrude the dough '
            'with bronze dies. An artisanal method, extruding dough with '
            'bronze dies, creates a rougher surface making it easy to hug to '
            'your favorite sauces. The resulting pasta boasts that famous '
            'Italian fresh-bread flavor and al dente bite.\n'
            'About Our Olive Oil\n'
            'Grown and hand-harvested in lush orchards of Puglia, Italy, the '
            'olives that go into every bottle of our fresh, fruity '
            'extra-virgin olive oil are produced with the utmost care to the '
            'surrounding environment. Our Biodynamic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is '
            'created from the first, cold press of Italian-grown olives to '
            'maintain its rich olive flavor: robust and fruity with a light, '
            'peppery finish.',

            'We began using Biodynamic techniques in our farming in 1999 '

            'practices and in 2009 we received USDA/NOP organic certification '
            'and in 2012 our Biodynamic® certification. More than 500 lavender '

 'profile': 'We are a small family run company owned and operated by Lynda '
            'Rockwell. Lynda’s first trip to the Northern Plains in 1982 '
            'resulted in her total dedication to the organic industry. For the '
            'past 30+ years Lynda has been working to supply domestic and '
            'export markets with organic and biodynamic® products. These '
            'efforts have supported not only the Northern Plains Sustainable '
            'Agricultural Society, that started as a small group of 35 farmers '
            'and since has grown to almost 600, but also many other organic '
            'farmers outside the group.\n'
            'Jessica Rockwell joined the ISIS Biodynamic portion of the '
            'company in 2012. Jessica had grown up around the organic “buzz” '
            'at home and as an adult has come to realize the health and '
            'overall benefits of the organic lifestyle. A recent university '
            'graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing and an Associates '
            'degree in Merchandising, Jessica brings much knowledge, skill and '
            'enthusiasm to the business.\n'
            'OUR BIODYNAMIC FARMER\n'
            'Our farmer, Fred Kirschenmann, converted to Biodynamic® farming '
            'from organic farming in 1982. His farm, just West of the James '
            'River in North Dakota, has been certified Biodynamic by the\u2028'
            'Demeter® Association for over 31 years! Not only has Fred been a '
            'dedicated Biodynamic® farmer, but he has also been a strong '
            'public and private advocate of organic farming – working with '
            'universities, extension agencies, local and federal government '
            'agencies and many others to further the growth of organic farming '
            'locally and nationwide. He has written many publications, books '
            'and hundreds of speeches in support of soil building and other '
            'farming practices that the organic and Biodynamic® farms '
            'embrace.\n'
            'OUR MILLER\n'
            'Our miller is Gary Thelen of Freeport, Minnesota. Gary is a third '
            'generation miller who took over the 100+ year old historic flour '
            'mill from his father, Walter. The mill has been in his family '
            'since 1903 and was listed on the National Register of Historic '
            'Places. As a young man, Gary worked on the family farm and was '
            'married to Sharon in 1982. In 1985 he began to focus more on the '
            'milling operation and in 1998 he completely took over the mill. '
            'Since then Gary has been carrying on and growing the family '
            'business. On December 27, 2011, two days after Christmas, Gary’s '
            'entire historic mill burned to the ground. With much '
            'encouragement from family, friends and business associates Gary '
            'rebuilt a new mill on the same site and struggled to rebuild his '
            'business.\n'
            'HOW THE PUZZLE FITS TOGETHER\n'
            'In the Fall of 2011 Lynda had an idea . . . what a great gift it '
            'would be to bring a Biodynamic Whole Wheat Flour into the world. '
            'And, as she shared this dream with her daughter, Jessica, the '
            'question arose, “What’s holding you back?” This simple question '
            'was the beginning of our journey to ISIS Biodynamic.\n'
            'Lynda began to seek out a stone-grinding flour mill and luckily, '
            'through a friend in the industry, was able to locate one. We '
            'needed a place to put it and thought of Gary back in Freeport '
            'trying to recover from the fire. We asked Gary if he would house '
            'the mill and make our flour. He agreed and the mill was '
            'installed, inspected and certified by the Demeter Association.\n'
            'Meanwhile Lynda and Jess had been making periodic visits to the '
            'Stone Barns Center for Agriculture in New York to see Fred '
            'Kirschenmann. We mentioned to Fred that we had purchased a mill '
            'and wanted to make Biodynamic® Whole Wheat Flour from his Wheat. '
            'Fred loved the idea and agreed to grow the Wheat for us.\n'
            'The rest is history, or should we say, the future! We are also '
            'delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Whole Foods '
            'Market team, and appreciate their dedication and support of '
            'providing Biodynamic® products nationwide.\n'
            'We truly hope ISIS Biodynamic® brings something delicious and '
            'fruitful to your kitchen and life!',

 'profile': 'We are a small family owned ranch on the western range of the '
            'Napa Valley. We both grew up on small farms in the Midwest and '
            'never expected to fall in love with a piece of land again, but we '
            'did!  Our ranch is rugged and suited to vineyards, aromatic '
            'plants, trees, and goats (our compost makers).\n'
            'We began using Biodynamic techniques in our farming in 1999 '
            'because our vines were weak and our grapes, not ripening.  Not '
            'only did our grapes ripen, but we increased production by 90%. '
            'The health of our soil has improved so much we barely irrigate '
            'the vines.\n'
            'We grow chardonnay grapes as well as lavender, rosemary, rose '
            'geranium, helichrysum italicum and are excitedly awaiting our '
            'first bumper crop of fuyu persimmons. Most of our lavender is '
            'Grosso, a lavendin, a hybrid of spike lavender and English '
            'lavender. It has about 16 times the amount of oil as true English '
            'lavender, which makes it ideal for dried flowers. We are '
            'experimenting with an English lavender developed in Oregon, Buena '
            'Vista, to see how it survives our winters. We dry some of the '
            'lavender and Donald estate distills the aromatics. We sell the '
            'hydrosols to small cosmetic makers as well as wholesale to local '
            'stores and we have a store on the internet. Once a year when the '
            'lavender is in full bloom we have an Open House, which we '
            'announce on our website. (2014 we are taking a break due to '
            'replanting of significant amounts of lavender.)\n'

            "distributing organic foods, however we'd never been farmers.\n"

            'larger farm established in the 1830s and abandoned following '
            'WWII. We have added neighboring acreage that was part of the '
            'original farm and today our family farm totals 80 acres located '
            'in New York State in Allegany county. We have an abundance of '
            'long forgotten old growth apple trees where we have cleared brush '
            'and thorns (multi floral rose, grrrrr!) to give them light and '
            "space. We've planted a small orchard with more apples, as well as "
            "peaches, cherries, apricots, and pears. We're in the process of "
            'establishing a vineyard. Recently we began to wild forage ramps '
            'and deliver to farm to fork restaurants in Manhattan and Brooklyn '
            'and leading retailers like Wegmans. This year we started to '
            'inoculate bolts of beech logs with mycelium to grow mushrooms. We '
            "have chickens and ducks and turkeys. We have raised pigs. We're "

            'children are leading projects around the farm. We participate in '
            'farmer trainings locally and attend Biodynamic Conferences to '

            'Angela Macke in 2003. Her background in Holistic health, (as both '
            'a Registered Nurse, Educator, and Horticulturalist), plus her own '
            'positive experience utilizing gentle, natural rhythms to '
            'successfully manage an auto-immune disease, plays an integral '
            'role in the thoughtful creation of each original product. Around '
            'here, we believe that a holistic approach is the most effective '
            'way to restore optimal health and a sense of well being. Helping '
            'our customers to create healthy lifestyle habits that support the '
            'prevention of illness, increase overall vitality, passion for '
            'life, and supporting the path to full actualization of  our full '

            'goal of our work.\n'
            'Our Farm and production\n'

            'Program, and Demeter U.S. The exceptionally high quality '
            'botanicals are hand-harvested, dried in our licensed commercial '
            'farm kitchen, then finish blended in small batches by hand to '
            'promote consistency, to maximize freshness and with the intention '
            'of offering them to you in their most pristine state. We hope '
            'that you enjoy the maximal nutritive benefits as Mother Nature '
            'intended.\n'
            'Certifications and Process\n'
            'We believe in honest tea and honest advertising here. This means '
            'supporting local and foreign farmers through certified '
            '(third-party verified, which includes annual audits) Fair Trade '

            'Conscientious Packaging\n'
            'We believe in presenting these products in their most natural, '
            'loose form. They have been packaged in lovely, '
            'domestically-manufactured, polished silver tins to protect them '
            'from the elements. We used a local designer, and local printer '
            'for soy-based ink labels and other packaging needs using '
            'Earth-friendly sustainable materials. We hand blend to completion '
            'in small batches, then package and label our teas right here in '
            'our farm kitchen.\n'
            'Quality of Product / Quality of Life\n'
            'We wanted to make sure that taste wasn’t the only thing to feel '
            'good about. Ensuring the highest quality of tea for you and life '
            'for those who bring it to us is part of our mission. We honor all '
            'of those involved in bringing this extremely labor-intensive crop '
            'from the fields to our cup by paying everyone a proper living '
            'wage and encouraging the spiritual sacredness of the family unit '
            'and community with time off from work to recharge and to play in '

            'that you do. We hope that you will discover, (and hopefully learn '
            'to cherish), the ancient and life-giving ritual of having a “spot '
            'of tea.”\n'
            'For all of us here at Light of Day, tea is so more than an iced '
            'beverage to soothe your thirst in the Summertime, or to comfort '
            'your sore throat in the Wintertime.  We have come to appreciate '
            'that the commitment to daily self care  by taking time out to '
            'enjoy tea is a representative of the commitment and conscious '
            'choice  to live simply, and to live each day with a wonder and '
            'deep reverence for every created thing.\n'
            'We really appreciate you taking the time to learn about us, and '
            "hope that you'll visit our Press Page to watch a PBS special "
            'where we were featured, ad well as read other good press.\n'

            'We are mindful of where and how our ingredients are produced, '

            'does not purchase products or ingredients on the common market, '
            'but works closely with growers and processors in the US and '
            'around the world to offer the best products in ways that promote '
            'health, sustainability, and eco-awareness. We are passionate '

            'responsibility, and promoting respect and goodwill in our '
            'endeavors.\n'
            'Omica Organics is directly associated with Sophia’s Gardens in '
            'Sebastopol, California, a biodynamically-run farm that grows for '
            'our company, and who researches and archives information on '
            'biodynamic farming techniques. Sophia’s Gardens is a '
            'single-family owned farm where crops are picked by hand and '
            'processed manually using age-old techniques that preserve the '
            'goodness of the plant. Our founder’s involvement with '
            'Anthroposophic research, biodynamic farming and water-flow '
            'technology (based on Rudolph Steiner and Viktor Schauberger’s '
            'works) spans 38+ years.\n'
            'We contract with local farmers and ensure that they follow '
            'organic methodologies. We promote and buy organic only, inspiring '
            'farmers to follow organic practices, and encouraging '
            'manufacturers to promote organic farmers and farming techniques '
            'through economic need and markets. This not only supports farmers '
            'in the US, but helps to support an organic standard of industry '
            'in India and China. We purchase only from these organic farmers, '
            'then process without using synthetic solvents. We have partners '
            'on-site in these countries to verify adherence to strict organic '
            'standards.\n'
            'Our proprietary stevia is cultivated from an extensive network of '
            'family-owned stevia farms. Self-sustaining farming methods help '
            'preserve the naturally-beneficial phytochemicals of the stevia '
            'leaf. The stevia leaves are picked by hand at the peak of the '
            'growing season, then dried naturally using sunlight and fresh '
            'air. The support we provide helps to keep these historically '
            'significant farming practices from disappearing completely.\n'
            'We use no fillers or artificial ingredients and all capsules are '
            'non-gelatin vegetarian. No synthetic preservatives are found in '
            'our products. We use organic vegetable glycerin (made fresh '
            'specifically for our use; and not sourced from industrial '
            'byproducts) along with organic biodynamic grape alcohol to '
            'preserve our products when necessary.\n'
            'We endeavor to uphold eco-friendly office and shipping practices. '
            'For instance, the popcorn used in our shipping packaging is a '
            'biodegradable cornstarch product that breaks down completely '
            'within 2 months. Our paperless practices preserve trees, we print '
            'on the backs of used paper whenever feasible, and we recycle '
            'everything possible including shredded documents, food and drink '
            'containers, and toner/ink cartridges.  One of our US offices, '
            'located in an appropriately sunny climate, is completely solar '
            'powered, helping to reduce ozone emissions, and save trees that '
            'produce life-giving oxygen.\n'

            'Omica Organics is directly associated with Sophia’s Gardens in '
            'Sebastopol, California, a biodynamically-run farm that grows for '
            'our company, and who researches and archives information on '
            'biodynamic farming techniques. Sophia’s Gardens is a '
            'single-family owned farm where crops are picked by hand and '
            'processed manually using age-old techniques that preserve the '
            'goodness of the plant. Our founder’s involvement with '
            'Anthroposophic research, biodynamic farming and water-flow '
            'technology (based on Rudolph Steiner and Viktor Schauberger’s '
            'works) spans 38+ years.\n'
            'We contract with local farmers and ensure that they follow '
            'organic methodologies. We promote and buy organic only, inspiring '
            'farmers to follow organic practices, and encouraging '
            'manufacturers to promote organic farmers and farming techniques '
            'through economic need and markets. This not only supports farmers '
            'in the US, but helps to support an organic standard of industry '
            'in India and China. We purchase only from these organic farmers, '
            'then process without using synthetic solvents. We have partners '
            'on-site in these countries to verify adherence to strict organic '
            'standards.\n'
            'Our proprietary stevia is cultivated from an extensive network of '
            'family-owned stevia farms. Self-sustaining farming methods help '
            'preserve the naturally-beneficial phytochemicals of the stevia '
            'leaf. The stevia leaves are picked by hand at the peak of the '
            'growing season, then dried naturally using sunlight and fresh '
            'air. The support we provide helps to keep these historically '
            'significant farming practices from disappearing completely.\n'
            'We use no fillers or artificial ingredients and all capsules are '
            'non-gelatin vegetarian. No synthetic preservatives are found in '
            'our products. We use organic vegetable glycerin (made fresh '
            'specifically for our use; and not sourced from industrial '
            'byproducts) along with organic biodynamic grape alcohol to '
            'preserve our products when necessary.\n'
            'We endeavor to uphold eco-friendly office and shipping practices. '
            'For instance, the popcorn used in our shipping packaging is a '
            'biodegradable cornstarch product that breaks down completely '
            'within 2 months. Our paperless practices preserve trees, we print '
            'on the backs of used paper whenever feasible, and we recycle '
            'everything possible including shredded documents, food and drink '
            'containers, and toner/ink cartridges.  One of our US offices, '
            'located in an appropriately sunny climate, is completely solar '
            'powered, helping to reduce ozone emissions, and save trees that '
            'produce life-giving oxygen.\n'

 'profile': 'Tony Crabb and Barbara Grasseschi were ready for a change when '
            'they purchased a somewhat neglected vineyard just north of '
            'Healdsburg, California in 2000.\n'
            'Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive '
            'career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and '
            'finally to California’s Silicon Valley. After starting his own '
            'companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a '
            'vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, '
            'a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, '
            'rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and '
            'letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines '
            'held more interest for Barbara every day.\n'
            'Biodiversity\n'
            'Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium '
            'quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to '
            'us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the '
            'number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. '
            'Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract '
            'swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the '
            'vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil '
            'erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and '
            'provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats '
            'live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard '
            'areas, providing weed control for us – and entertainment for the '
            'neighbors.\n'
            'A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat '
            'for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central '
            'Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing '
            'and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.\n'
            'Energy Conservation\n'
            'Puma Springs’ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with '
            'our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need '
            'for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides '
            'power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative '
            'office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system '
            'provides all hot water for the office.\n'
            'Terroir\n'
            'Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard '
            'is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take '
            'advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited '
            'to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the '
            'vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze '
            'that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding '
            'valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.\n'
            'Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, '
            'Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of '
            'earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. '
            'Biodynamics is not only good for the earth and good for the '
            'environment; it helps produce exceptional wine grapes.\n'

            'Sebastopol, California, a biodynamically-run farm that grows for '
            'our company, and who researches and archives information on '
            'biodynamic farming techniques. Sophia’s Gardens is a '
            'single-family owned farm where crops are picked by hand and '
            'processed manually using age-old techniques that preserve the '
            'goodness of the plant. Our founder’s involvement with '
            'Anthroposophic research, biodynamic farming and water-flow '
            'technology (based on Rudolph Steiner and Viktor Schauberger’s '
            'works) spans 38+ years.\n'
            'We contract with local farmers and ensure that they follow '
            'organic methodologies. We promote and buy organic only, inspiring '
            'farmers to follow organic practices, and encouraging '
            'manufacturers to promote organic farmers and farming techniques '
            'through economic need and markets. This not only supports farmers '
            'in the US, but helps to support an organic standard of industry '
            'in India and China. We purchase only from these organic farmers, '
            'then process without using synthetic solvents. We have partners '
            'on-site in these countries to verify adherence to strict organic '
            'standards.\n'
            'Our proprietary stevia is cultivated from an extensive network of '
            'family-owned stevia farms. Self-sustaining farming methods help '
            'preserve the naturally-beneficial phytochemicals of the stevia '
            'leaf. The stevia leaves are picked by hand at the peak of the '
            'growing season, then dried naturally using sunlight and fresh '
            'air. The support we provide helps to keep these historically '
            'significant farming practices from disappearing completely.\n'
            'We use no fillers or artificial ingredients and all capsules are '
            'non-gelatin vegetarian. No synthetic preservatives are found in '
            'our products. We use organic vegetable glycerin (made fresh '
            'specifically for our use; and not sourced from industrial '
            'byproducts) along with organic biodynamic grape alcohol to '
            'preserve our products when necessary.\n'
            'We endeavor to uphold eco-friendly office and shipping practices. '
            'For instance, the popcorn used in our shipping packaging is a '
            'biodegradable cornstarch product that breaks down completely '
            'within 2 months. Our paperless practices preserve trees, we print '
            'on the backs of used paper whenever feasible, and we recycle '
            'everything possible including shredded documents, food and drink '
            'containers, and toner/ink cartridges.  One of our US offices, '
            'located in an appropriately sunny climate, is completely solar '

            'finally to California’s Silicon Valley. After starting his own '
            'companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a '
            'vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, '
            'a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, '
            'rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and '
            'letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines '
            'held more interest for Barbara every day.\n'
            'Biodiversity\n'
            'Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium '

            'swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the '

            'erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and '
            'provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats '
            'live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard '
            'areas, providing weed control for us – and entertainment for the '

            'for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central '
            'Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing '
            'and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.\n'
            'Energy Conservation\n'
            'Puma Springs’ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with '
            'our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need '

            'they purchased a somewhat neglected vineyard just north of '
            'Healdsburg, California in 2000.\n'
            'Tony, an English born and educated engineer, enjoyed a productive '
            'career that took him from England to South Africa to Scotland and '
            'finally to California’s Silicon Valley. After starting his own '
            'companies and working for other major corporations, the life of a '
            'vineyard owner grew more appealing. Meanwhile, his wife Barbara, '
            'a sales and marketing executive, was growing weary of airports, '
            'rental cars and hotels. Working in a vineyard, raising goats and '
            'letting the weather dictate her schedule rather than the airlines '
            'held more interest for Barbara every day.\n'
            'Biodiversity\n'
            'Promoting biodiversity is as important to us as producing premium '
            'quality grapes. When we give to the land, the land gives back to '
            'us. We provide nesting sites to attract raptors that reduce the '
            'number of gophers and other pests that can damage the vines. '
            'Strategically placed bird houses throughout the vineyard attract '
            'swallows and other birds that dine on insects harmful to the '
            'vines. A permanent cover crop between the rows prevents soil '
            'erosion, controls vine vigor, discourages unwanted weeds and '
            'provides a habitat for beneficial insects. A small herd of goats '
            'live in the area around the pond, munching in the non-vineyard '
            'areas, providing weed control for us – and entertainment for the '
            'neighbors.\n'
            'A variety of trees, shrubs and other vegetation provides habitat '
            'for a wide range of beneficial birds and insects. Our central '
            'Insectary attracts beneficial insects to the vineyard, reducing '
            'and possibly eliminating the need for insecticides.\n'
            'Energy Conservation\n'
            'Puma Springs’ Wind and Solar Photo Voltaic systems, along with '
            'our passive solar thermal water heating system minimize the need '
            'for non-renewable energy. The Wind and Solar PV array provides '
            'power to the irrigation pumps for the vineyard and administrative '
            'office, while the passive solar thermal water heating system '
            'provides all hot water for the office.\n'
            'Terroir\n'
            'Midway between the Alexander and Dry Creek Valleys the vineyard '
            'is ideally located on gently sloping hillsides that take '
            'advantage of the local microclimate. This spot is ideally suited '
            'to growing Bordeaux wine grapes. During the growing season the '
            'vineyard sees typically hot days and a cooling evening breeze '
            'that burns the fog away each morning earlier than the surrounding '
            'valleys. The soil is sandy clay loam.\n'
            'Today, because of the tireless dedication of our talented team, '
            'Puma Springs is a living, thriving, constantly evolving piece of '
            'earth that produces some of the finest grapes in Sonoma County. '
