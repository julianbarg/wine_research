His vision and commitment to build a legacy and business for his family led to the acquisition of nearly 1,000 acres. Nearly two decades later, in the late 1970s, that vision came to fruition when his son David began planting vines on the property. In 2007, David’s daughter Laura joined the family business to run the daily operations. Today, two generations work together to continue the family tradition at David Arthur Vineyards.
