Located on a warm southeast facing slope of the Chehalem Ridge, fruit at this vineyard is harvested a week or two before other REX HILL Pinot Noir sites.

           ","The Pearl Vineyard, named after our first Scottish Highland cow, was first planted in 2002 by Cheryl Francis & Sam Tannahill on the coveted Jory soils in the Red Hills of Dundee, achieving first crop in 2005. The 5-acre vineyard is home to a field blend of 18 different rootstocks and clones of Pinot Noir, designed to all be fermented together to increase complexity and depth of flavor. The vineyard itself sits on a 10-acre farm that also grows olives, apples, walnuts, plums, cherries and various other berries and fruits. The vineyard has been farmed to Biodynamic tenets since 2000 and was Demeter and Organic (Stellar) certified in 2005. We create our own compost for this vineyard as well as all of the Biodynamic preparations. There are three distinct sites within this small vineyard with varying amounts of topsoil and fractured Basalt. Each block is planted with a rootstock that will help the vine prosper in their unique situation.","Fruit, Grapes For Wine",,Cropped: 5.12 Acres,Total Acreage: 10 Acres

It was once an old hazelnut orchard, but as hazelnuts became unviable in the late 1990s, it made sense that the orchard become a vineyard. On the 10-acre property there are 7.5 acres planted to Pinot Noir grapes with the remaining acreage set aside for gardens. Within the gardens still remain a few hazelnut trees keeping the legacy alive. The Dundee Hills were formed between 6 and 17 million years ago by the Columbia River lava flows that made its way from the Oregon-Idaho border all the way to the coast. The lava solidified to form basalt. Over the years the rock weathered away in the high rainfalls of the Willamette Valley to form deep red clay soils. These volcanic soils are exceptionally good for growing grapes, particularly Pinot Noir.","Fruit, Grapes For Wine",,Cropped: 7.5 Acres,Total Acreage: 10 Acres
